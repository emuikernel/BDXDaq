The following display list objects are being parsed:
(will put the grammar into EBNF form sometime)

General rules:  order of things in display list
	+ file
	+ display
	+ attributes and static objects ...
	+ dynamic attributes and static objects...
	+ monitors
	+ controllers
	+ plots


TOP LEVEL OBJECTS
=================

Static Objects:
---------------

file
display = {object, cmap, clr, bclr}
<<color map>> = {ncolors, dl_color}
<<basic atribute>> = {attr}
<<dynamic attribute>> = {(dyn)attr}			# not fully implemented
rectangle = {object}
oval = {object}
arc = {object, begin, path}
text = {object, textix, align, format}
falling line = {object}
rising line = {object}
related display = {object, clr, bclr}


Monitor Objects:
----------------

bar = {object, monitor, label, clrmod, direction, fillmod, pad}
indicator						# not yet implemented
meter = {object, monitor, label, clrmod, pad}
strip chart						# not fully implemented
text update = {object, monitor, clrmod, format, align, pad}


Controller Objects:
-------------------

choice button = {object, control, label, clrmod, stacking, pad}
	(button == choice button)
message button			# not yet implemented
menu				# not yet implemented
text entry			# not yet implemented
valuator = {object, control, label, clrmod, direction, pad}



NESTED OBJECTS
==============
dl_color = {r, g, b, inten}
object = {x, y, width, height}
attr = {clr, style, fill, width}
(dyn)attr = {mod, chan}
display[i] = {label, name, args}
monitor = {rdbk, clr, bclr}
control = {ctrl, clr, bclr}
plotcom				# not yet implemented
pen				# not yet implemented



OTHER KEYWORDS
==============

clr
bclr





Current State of Affairs
========================
========================

clrmod = {static, alarm, discrete}
   static: color = foreground color
   alarm:  color = alarm color (based on current channel alarm condition)
   discrete: implemented as alarm (so does LANL)

label = {none, outline, limits, channel}
   none: no label
   outline: no label
   limits:  include low and high limits in display
   channel: include low and high limits and channel name
