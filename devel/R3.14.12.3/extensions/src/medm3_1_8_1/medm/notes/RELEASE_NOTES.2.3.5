     MEDM 2.3.5 is now available.  This version has been in use for
operations at the Advanced Photon Source since December with no
significant problems.

    It should be noted that the version of MEDM released by BESSY as
2.4.xxx was originally based on the Argonne MEDM, but is now a
different program.  This notice applies to the original MEDM.

Version 2.3.5
=============

1.  Allows the limits and the precision for objects such as Meters,
Sliders, and Text Updates can be specified at design time and changed
at run time, instead of being set by fields such as HOPR, LOPR, and
PREC in the associated record.

2. Fixes the Menu and Choice Button so their size is what is specified
at design time and what is stored in the ADL file. They are now the
same size in both EDIT and EXECUTE mode and have the same look as
other MEDM objects. The objects are now a few pixels smaller than they
used to be. The impact is more noticeable for small versions of these
objects, and small versions may need to be resized on existing screens
to look attractive.

3. Entails a rewrite of the PV Info logic.  The DESC and RTYP fields
of a process variable have been added to the PV Info Dialog Box.

4. Has a "Save All" option on the File menu. 

5. Has consistent shadows on all items with shadows.  Highlights have
been removed from all objects.  Sizes are consistent in EDIT and
EXECUTE mode and are what is specified in the ADL file except for
minimum size requirements.

6. Has several bug fixes.

     See the reference manual for a more detailed description.  It is

     Statically-linked versions that have been authorized for
XRT/graph are available.  See Bakul Bannerjee (banerjee@aps.anl.gov)
for information on how to obtain these versions or how to obtain MEDM
in general.

     There is a beta testing group for MEDM.  If you are interested in
having the latest version, can build MEDM (or extract the Solaris
version from the TAR file), and are willing to help test, let me know
(evans@aps.anl.gov), and I will put you on the distribution list.

     A Windows 95/98/NT version of MEDM is available and is current
with 2.3.5.  It comes as an Install Shield self-extracting executable.
It requires the Exceed X Server from Hummingbird.  It uses SciPlot
(see the MEDM manual) instead of XRT/Graph.  See Bakul (address above)
for details on how to obtain it.  The current version is build 14,
EPICSEx14-win32.exe.  If you read the README file and are familiar
with Windows, you should have no trouble installing it -- it has been
installed successfully by a number of people and organizations.  It
can be easily removed and should do no damage to your computer.  If
you need to access EPICS from a PC over a modem, running MEDM on the
PC rather than remotely can be much faster.
