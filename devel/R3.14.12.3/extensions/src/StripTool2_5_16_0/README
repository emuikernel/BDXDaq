  This application is based on the original stripTool program by Janet
Anderson at Argonne National Lab.  The current version was designed and
written by Chris Larrieu at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator 
Facility.

  To build, modify Makefile.Unix, if necessary, to select whether to build
on top of Channel Access or cdev.  If on top of cdev, make sure that the
$CDEV and $LIBDIR variables point to the base of the cdev distribution, and
the directory under $CDEV/lib where the libraries exist, respectively.  In
either case, make sure that $EPICS points to the base of the EPICS
distribution.  Type "make build".

  Several defaults and compiled-in values are defined in StripDefines.h.  You
might want to look in here to see if there is anything you want to change.

  Chris's work and work at DESY were merged into this code in 2002 by
Kenneth Evans, ANL.

  See the manual, StripTool.html, in this distribution for more
information.  If you modify the manual, please use Amaya.  It is good
for collaborations since it produces good HTML and does not reformat
existing HTML.  This helps with CVS.
