# The makeTestfile.pl script generates a file $target.t which is needed
# because some versions of the Perl test harness can only run test scripts
# that are actually written in Perl.  The script we generate execs the
# real test program which must be in the same directory as the .t file.

# Usage: makeTestfile.pl target.t executable
#     target.t is the name of the Perl script to generate
#     executable is the name of the file the script runs
