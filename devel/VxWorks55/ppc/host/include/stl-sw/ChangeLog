        ** Porting SGI STL to SunPro C++ 4.1,4.2 & gcc-2.7.2
	**
	** Has been successfully tested on cygnus STL test suite (
        ** ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++/stl-examples.tgz, with additional
        ** check for separate compilation & multiple units.
	**
	** GCC 2.7.2 works fine on sparc-solaris2.5, i386-solaris2.4,
	** Linux (+/- frepo).
	**
        ** SunPro C++ 4.1 ( SC 4.0 set ) cannot properly handle Templates.DB
        ** dependencies in case of multiple targets ( some tests lacks
        ** certain dependencies and fail to link. Single file mode works. )
	**
	** C++ 4.2 works fine.
        ** C++ 4.1 seems to have optimization errors ( coredump on
	** 'nthelem1' test from the set. No problems with -g ;(.
	** 
	** Borland C++ 5.01 have problems compiling from command-line.
	** The same problems arise when using Borland own STL.
	** IDE compiler works fine.
	**
	
	* algo.h  : added configuration define HAVE_RAND48.

	* algobase.h : min & max definitios for Borland guarded by
	  __MINMAX_DEFINED. No inclusion of <stdlib> needed.
	
        * alloc.h : Original functinality provided for gcc.
	  __malloc_alloc_oom_handler changed to be static
          template data member. ( I believe that was a bug).
	  __default_alloc_template ported to gcc.
	  gcc is no longer forced to __USE_MALLOC.
          Instantiations for instance_no==0 provided in <statics.h> for gcc.

        * bool.h : __NEED_BOOL for __SUNPRO_CC defined for versions up to
          4.2 to reflect absence of 'bool'.
          __NEED_BOOL setting for g++ changed - _G_HAVE_BOOL is not
          a built-in definition and won't work.
          auto-definitions of HAVE_TEMPLATE_PARAM_BUG &
          HAVE_STATIC_TEMPLATE_DATA for gcc up to 2.7.2 added.
	  Configuration for HAVE_WEAK_ATTRIBUTE added.
	  Warning added for systems that must include <statics.h>
	  Inappropriate place choosen since no configuration header
          exist.

        * bvector.h : defined as vector<bool> for compilers that support
	  bool type. Added hook for defining Alloc for it.
	  added friend declaration of iterator_category() &
	  distance_type() to help gcc & the like in type unification

	* deque.h : Original functinality provided for all compilers.
	  Added syntax workarounds for gcc. Warnings suppressed.

 	* pthread_alloc.h : ported to gcc. Not tested, although.

        * statics.h : additional file created for compilers like g++-2.7.2
          that doesn`t handle template static data members definitions.
          This file is truly optional and not required for better compilers.

        * tempbuf.h : get_temporary_buffer() : added cast to help SunPro
          CC in type unification.
        
        * tree.h : nil_node & NIL changed to be static inline data members.
          Helper template class __rb_tree_meta introduced to avoid problem
          with multiple definition of non-template static data members when
          linking multiple compilation units. Single template definition
          of __rb_tree_meta<false>::nil_node provided in statics.h for g++ &
          the like.
	  iterator_category() & distance_type() fixed : functions
          declared inline to avoid linker errors in multi-file case.
	  node_count & key_compare initializers swapped to get rid of
          compiler warnings. Added syntax workarounds for gcc & the like.
        
        * vector.h : Original functionality provided via __vector__.
	  Added syntax workarounds for gcc. Comparison of vectors with 
	  different allocators made possible.
