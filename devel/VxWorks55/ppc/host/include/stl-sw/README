ABSTRACT

The main goal was to retain original ( as with default template
parameters ) STL functionality for most compilers. 

For most containers, it is implemented in the following way : 
Full functionality for 'container' is implemented via class '__container__'.
You may then define some new name for it in your programs, and simple switch
the definition when compiler change. 
For compiler that support namespaces ( Visual C++), full versions of
containers put to "std::sgi_full" namespace. __container__ is provided
as "sgi_full::__container__".

Added namespace support for appropriate compilers.
Added exception handling support.
Added debug mode support.

See ChangeLog file for details.

TESTING SUMMARY

Has been successfully tested using cygnus STL test suite 
( ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++/stl-examples.tar.gz )
, with additional check for separate compilation & multiple units.

GCC 2.7.2 (+/- frepo) works on sparc-solaris2.5, i386-solaris2.4, linux-i386, some cross-platform 
    configurations. Cygnus version included in cygwin32 package works on Win95/NT, (auto-recognized).

    SunPro C++ 4.0.1 (from SC 3.0.1 set) may require some workarounds on link stage. (auto-recognized)

    SunPro C++ 4.1 (from SC 4.0 set) cannot properly handle Templates. DB dependencies 
    in case of multiple targets (some tests lack certain dependencies and fail to link. 
    Single file mode works. Also seems to have optimization errors 
    (core dump on 'nthelem1' test from the set. No problems with -g ;(. (auto-recognized)

    SunPro C++ 4.2 compiler works fine. (auto-recognized)

    Borland C++ 5.01 (auto-recognized)

    Visual C++ 4.x compilers work. (auto-recognized)

    Visual C++ 5.0 works. (auto-recognized) 

    SGI MIPSpro C++ 7.x was reported to work .(auto-recognized)

    AIX xlC 3.1.4.0 was reported to work (auto-recognized).

    KAI C++ 3.1c was reported to work (configuring is necessary).

    DEC C++ V5.5-004 was reported to work on OSF 3.2/4.0 (configuring is necessary).

    Watcom C++ 11.0 was reported to work (auto-recognized)

KNOWN PROBLEMS

Some compilers, altough supported, still have problems.
Refer to README.<your compiler version> if appropriate.
