# 01e,15nov01,pad  created, derived from VxWorks AE's makeSymTbl.sh (base
#		   version makeSymTbl.sh@@/main/tor3_x/5)
# 
# SYNOPSIS:
# .tS
# makeSymTbl <cpu family> <object module>
# .tE
#
# DESCRIPTION
# This tool is used only when creating a standalone system (with no access to
# a secondary storage). Its purpose is to create the C code for symbol table
# structures holding the system's symbols. These structures are then compiled
# and linked into the system image to allow for the usage of the shell,
# the loader, etc.
#
# Note: this script is not intended to be used directly from the command line.
#       It is called via the project's makefiles when the
#       INCLUDE_STANDALONE_SYM_TBL component is included.
#
# For an example, see the generated files:
# \f3$WIND_BASE/target/proj/<project>/<build spec>/symTbl.c\f1,
