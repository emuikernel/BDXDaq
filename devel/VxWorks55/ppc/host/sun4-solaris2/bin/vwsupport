#
# Copyright 1984-1995 Wind River Systems, Inc.
#
# modification history
# --------------------
# 01c,09jun95,p_m  doc tweaks for Tornado.
# 01b,26jul93,md3  added support id slot.
# 01a,24sep93,kdl  created from vwbug v.01m.
#
# SYNOPSIS
# .tS
# vwsupport [-o <outfile>] [<recipients>]
# .tE
#
# DESCRIPTION
# This tool creates a Technical Support Request (TSR) and mails it 
# to `support@wrs.com'.
# The user is placed in the editor with a TSR
# template.  When the user exits the editor, the report is mailed,
# automatically.
#
# This tool should be used for normal technical support inquiries.
# To submit a software problem (bug) report on any Wind River Systems
# product, please use the vwbug tool instead.
#
# Please complete the form as completely as possible.  This will
# greatly assist Wind River Technical Support in addressing your
# problems.
#
# This script may be edited to define default strings to be used in
# specific fields in the report form.  For example, you may want to
# modify the script so that your Wind River Systems license number,
# the company name, address and phone are automatically included.  
# To do so, change the definitions in the
# section of the vwsupport script under the heading "Customer-Specific
# Configuration."
#
# This script is intended to be used for requesting assistance with any
# Wind River Systems product.  If you want to setup default values
# in the request form for the particular product and version you are
# using, you may edit the definitions in the vwsupport script under the
# heading "Default Product Description."
#
# All fields may be modified when submitting a support request, even
# those for which default values have been defined.
# 
# OPTIONS:
# .iP "-o <outfile>" 18 3
# the report is saved in <outfile> for printing.
# .iP <recipients>
# additional copies of the report are mailed to the specified recipients.
# .LP
#
# CAVEAT
# A mail path to `wrs.com' must exist if the report is to be successfully
# routed to WRS.  The script can be edited to set the appropriate mail path.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
# vwsupport uses the editor specified by the environment variables
# VISUAL or EDITOR if they are set, otherwise it uses \f3vi\fP.
#
# SEE ALSO
# vwbug, launch

#TSR_FORMAT
Please complete the attached form as accurately as possible.

For each field begin text immediately after the colon.  Please keep
the SYNOPSIS concise and use keywords; try to limit it to 60
characters.  For DETAILED DESCRIPTION, DEMONSTRATION, and WORK-AROUND
sections, type text on a new line (as many as needed).  Do not modify
any capitalized headings.  The CUSTOMER REFERENCE# heading is
provided for your internal tracking needs -- it is not used by WRS.
Please limit one problem or subject per form; isolate it to a small
example -- include code in machine readable format if possible.

If you wish to cancel: either exit without modification, or create an
empty file then exit.

--- The above text will be automatically deleted before being mailed. ---
