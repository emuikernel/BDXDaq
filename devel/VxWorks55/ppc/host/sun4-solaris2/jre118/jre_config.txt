Overview of Java Runtime
-------------------------

The JRE is the minimum standard Java Platform for running Java programs.  It 
contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Core Classes and supporting files.
 
Invoke the JRE from the command line by using the jre tool (see the following
section). Specify an application's class path by using the -cp option.
The JRE includes all of the non-debuggable .so files plus the necessary classes from the JDK 1.1.8 to support a runtime-only program.  The JRE does not include any of the development tools (such as appletviewer or javac) or classes that 
would pertain only to a development system.

In this document, the term "vendors" refers to licensees, developers, and 
independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and distribute the JRE with
their Java programs.  Vendors must follow the terms of the JRE Binary Code 
License agreement, which includes these terms:

1.  Do not arbitrarily subset the JRE. You may omit only the files listed below as optional.
 
2.  Include in your product's license the provisions called out in the JRE 
Binary Code License.

Vendors should also be aware of the support conditions relating to the JRE.

The Java Runtime
----------------

The jre tool invokes the Java Runtime for executing Java applications. The tool is available in the Solaris SPARC(tm) and Solaris Intel downloads of the JRE. The syntax for the jre command is:

jre [ options ] classname <args>

The classname argument is the name of the class file to be executed. Put
arguments to be passed to the class following the classname on the command line.
Use the -cp option to specify an application's class path.

Options for the jre command are as follows:

-classpath path		
Specifies the path that jre uses to look up classes. Overrides the default
 classpath.

-cp path		
Prepends the specified path to the default classpath that jre uses to look up 
classes. 

-help			
Prints a usage message.

-mx x			
Sets the maximum size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected heap) to x. The default is 16 megabytes of memory. x must be greater than or equal 
to 1000 bytes. By default, x is measured in bytes. To specify x in either 
kilobytes or megabytes, append "k" for kilobytes, or "m" for megabytes. 

-ms x			
Sets the startup size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected heap)
to x. The default is 4 megabytes of memory. x must be greater than 1000 bytes.
By default, x is measured in bytes. To specify x in either kilobytes or 
megabytes, append "k" for kilobytes, or "m" for megabytes. 

-noasyncgc		
Turns off asynchronous garbage collection. When activated, no garbage 
collection takes place unless it is explicitly called or the program runs out 
of memory.

-noclassgc		
Turns off garbage collection of Java classes. By default, the Java runtime 
reclaims space for unused Java classes during garbage collection.

-nojit			
Specifies that any Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler should be ignored and instead 
invokes the default Java interpreter.

-ss x			
The -ss option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by C code in a 
thread to x. The default units for x are bytes. The value of x must be greater 
than or equal to 1000 bytes. To specify x in either kilobytes or megabytes, 
append "k" for kilobytes, or "m" for megabytes. 

-oss x			
The -oss option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by Java code in a
thread to x. The default units for x are bytes. The value of x must be greater
than or equal to 1000 bytes. To specify x in either kilobytes or megabytes, 
append "k" for kilobytes, or "m" for megabytes. 

-v,-verbose			
Causes jre to print a message to stdout each time a class file is loaded.

-verify			
Performs byte-code verification on the class file. Be aware, however, that java 
-verify does not perform a full verification in all situations. Any code path
that is not executed is not verified. Therefore, java -verify cannot be relied 
on to certify class files unless all code paths in the class file are actually 
run.

-verifyremote		
Runs the verifier on all code that is loaded into the system via a classloader. 
verifyremote is the default.

-noverify			
Turns verification off.

-verbosegc			
Causes the garbage collector to print out messages whenever it frees memory.

-DpropName=value		
Defines a property value. propName is the name of the property whose value you 
want to change and value is the value to change it to. For example, the command 

			java -Dawt.button.color=green ...

sets the value of the property awt.button.color to "green".

Required vs. Optional Files
---------------------------

Licensees must follow the terms of the accompanying LICENSE. The files that make up the JRE are divided into two categories: required and optional.  To 
paraphrase that license, files that are marked "optional" here do not need to be included with the licensee's program. Most of the optional files provide 
localization support for languages.

The term "required" means that licensees who distribute the runtime must include those files with their program, regardless of whether those files are used by 
their program.  These files are a required part of the Java Platform.

The JRE includes the bin and lib directories which both must reside in the same 
directory, <runtime-dir>.

In the following lists, all paths are relative to the <runtime-dir> directory 
(which is originally Solaris_JRE_.1.8_09).

Required Files

When redistributing the JRE, include the entire set of native threads files.

The Solaris bin directory contains the shell scripts and executables:

bin/.java_wrapper			Java runtime shell script
bin/javakey  				(symlink to .java_wrapper)
bin/jre  				(symlink to .java_wrapper)
bin/rmiregistry				(symlink to .java_wrapper)
bin/<sys>/.extract_args
bin/<sys>/javakey
bin/<sys>/jre
bin/<sys>/rmiregistry

where <sys> = sparc/native_threads or i386/native_threads

The Solaris lib directory and its subdirectories contain the classes, 
properties files and native libraries:

lib/rt.jar	 		Java runtime core classes
lib/content-types.properties	MIME-type properties 
lib/awt.properties	 	properties for key events for java.awt
lib/font.properties	 	Solaris font properties for java.awt

How to Bundle and Run the Java Runtime
======================================

Bundling the Java Runtime
-------------------------

When bundling the JRE with application software on Solaris, consider the 
following points:

1. Install the JRE in its own subdirectory (referred to below as <runtime-dir>).  Include all the required files listed above in the bin and lib subdirectories 
of <runtime-dir>, following the same directory hierarchy and relative placement 
of files.  The internationalization files marked optional can be included for 
language localization support.

2. It is suggested that all application-specific classes be placed in a 
directory other than <runtime-dir>. Application-specific classes may be 
individual .class files, .jar files, or .zip files. 

An example directory structure might look like the following:

              <app-dir>
  _________________|_________
  |          |               |
 bin        lib          <runtime-dir>
  |          |	     ________|________	     
		     |		     |
                    bin             lib
		     |               |


3. If native code support is required, then the native library must be located 
in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The best way to do this is to install the native libraries 
in <app-dir>/lib/<sys>. Then set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include these directories.

4. The application can be invoked by using the JRE command-line tool, using the 
-cp option to specify the application's class path. In the example directory 
tree above, for example, the command might look like this:

<app-dir>/<runtime-dir>/bin/jre -cp <app-dir>/lib/app.jar <classname>

For more information that might be relevant to installing and running the JRE, 
refer to the JDK installation instructions:

http://java.sun.com/jdk/1.1/installation-solaris2.html

Java Runtime Example
--------------------

The following Web page has a "Hello World" example that you can download, which 
demonstrates how to create a simple Java application that runs on and is bundled with a JRE.
  
http://www.sun.com/solaris/jre/1.1/example/index.html

This example shows how to make a simple, seamless transition from developing an 
application with the JDK to deploying it with the more lightweight JRE.

Runtime Documentation
---------------------

Runtime documentation is any documentation that an end-user might need after 
installing a Java program that runs on the JRE. We supply the following runtime 
documentation:

1.  Each property file contains comments that describe what the file is useful 
for and how to modify it.

2.  awt.properties file - KeyEvent uses it to print out properties of key 
events, usually for debugging purposes.  This might be used by a GUI debugger 
that needs to print out events.

3.  fontprop.html file has a Web page describing how to add fonts to the 
runtime:

http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/intl/fontprop.html

Version and Vendor Identification
---------------------------------

To enable customers to identify the JRE version and vendor for troubleshooting 
purposes, once the JVM is running, reference one of these methods:

java.lang.System.getProperties() (all properties)
	or
java.lang.System.getProperty("java.version") (single property)

The relevant properties are:

Properties		Description

java.version		Java version number
java.vendor		Java vendor-specific string
java.vendor.url		Java vendor URL
java.class.version	Java class format version number
java.compiler		Java compiler
os.name			Operating system name
os.arch			Operating system architecture
os.version		Operating system version

Optionally:
 
Properties	Description

java.home	Java installation directory
java.class.path	Java class path
