# DESCRIPTION
# This files defines a 2 dimension tcl array. Its first index is parameter, and
# the second index is one of NAME and VALUE. An element with NAME as the second
# index tells how the parameter name should be migrated: remove it if the value
# of the element is ""; rename to the value of the element if not empty.
# Likewise, an element with VALUE as the second index tells how the parameter
# value should be migrated.
