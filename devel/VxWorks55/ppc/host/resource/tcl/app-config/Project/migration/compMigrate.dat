# DESCRIPTION
# This files defines a tcl array indexed by combination of version, component
# and MIGRATION/LOG. The value of the version+component+MIGRATION indexed
# element is the component which the indexing component should be replaced
# with while the value of the version+component+LOG indexed element is the log
# message for the indexing component. If the value of an 
# version+component+MIGRATION indexed element is "", then the indexing 
# component should be removed.
