# This file contains the list of OMF readers the target server may dynamically
# use to handle object modules.
#
# The format must be: <CPU_FAMILY> <OMF> <DLL>
# Where <CPU_FAMILY> is a valid CPU_FAMILY name as defined in cputypes.h
#       <OMF> is the Object Module Format Name.
#       <DLL> is the name of the shared object file holding the OMF reader.
#             This file should be located in wpwr/host/lib/<host>
# Note that a <CPU_FAMILY>/<OMF> couple should correspond to only one <DLL>,
# otherwise, only the first occurence is considered.
#
# A comment line must start with the '#' character
