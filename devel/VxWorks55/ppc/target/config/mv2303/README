                 README: Motorola MVME260x/230x/360x/2700

This file contains board-specific information for the Motorola MVME260x,
MVME230x, MVME360x, and MVME2700 target board families in support of the
mv2303, mv2304, mv2603, mv2604, mv3603, mv3604, and mv2700 BSPs.  Specifically,
this file contains information on any BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and contains caveats that the user must be
aware of before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target board's reference
entry (for example, mv2603/target.nr) provides board-specific information
necessary to run VxWorks, and should be read before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 1.2/1

        Unified Tornado 2.2 VxWorks 5.5 release.
        Updated build rules for Tornado 2.2.

RELEASE 1.2/0:
	
	First release for Tornado 2.0 

RELEASE 1.1/5.1: Motorola BSP Patch
        Added VMEbus DMA support
        Fixed support for SM_OFF_BOARD
        Fixed Com port hang due to phantom interrupt
        Turned on Falcon's ECC
        Added TAS support which uses the VMEbus RMW

RELEASE 1.1/5:
	This release adds the mv2700 BSP as a family member. The special
	module pciIomapLib is replaced with the new generic module:
	pciConfigLib.  The special DEC 21140 driver is replaced with the
	upgraded generic driver if_dc.o.

	SPR 21251: For ROM resident code elfToBin fails. It is possible
	to use elfToBsd followed by aoutToBin to achieve the desired
	results.

RELEASE (BSP Version 1.1/4): BSP Re-release
	This re-release provides support for the MVME230x, MVME260x, and
	MVME360x PowerPC board families.  It contains a new Universe
	interrupt controller, support for serial ports 3 and 4, and
	bus-specific vxMemProbe support.  It fixes numerous SPRs:
	8022, 8289, 8430, 8432, 8434, 8492, 8544, 8560, 8566, 8824, 8826, 8827,
	8842, 8896, 8897, 8911, 8954, 8956, 8978, 9019, 9063, 9085, 9285, 9310,
	9352, 9388, 9389, 9404, 9438, 9482, 9543, 9654, 9696, 9717, 9726, 9760.

	IMPORTANT: Development with this BSP requires that you also install
	"Tornado object patch: PPC" from the CD.  If it has not already been
	installed, rerun the SETUP command on the CD and select just "Tornado
	object patch: PPC".  The patch contains PowerPC architecture
	enhancements which are utilized by this BSP and must be installed if
	the boot or vxWorks images are to be remade.

	If difficulty is encountered, please contact Wind River Systems
	Customer Support.

RELEASE (BSP Version 1.1/3): Jumbo Patch 2
	This release provides a new ravenMpic driver, a new dec21140
	driver.

RELEASE (BSP Version 1.1/2): Jumbo Patch 1

	Includes support code from Motorola for MPIC interrupt handling and
	extended VME addressing.  Also has support for the PMC Span board
	and new PCI bus support which is fully compliant with Revision 2.1
	of the PCI Bus standard.

	Note: due to known code irregularities, whenever a change is made to
	the definition for LOCAL_MEM_SIZE, INCLUDE_MPIC, VME_A32_MSTR_LOCAL or
	EXTENDED_VME or the INCLUDEs for SCSI or ETHERNET, a new boot image
	must also be made and programmed into Flash.


RELEASE (BSP Version 1.1/1):

	Added support for Enhanced Network Device (END).


RELEASE (BSP Version 1.1/0):

	First FCS release of this BSP by WRS.  Includes Beta releases from
