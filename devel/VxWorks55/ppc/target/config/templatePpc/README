This file contains board-specific information for the TEMPLATE
target board.  This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and informs the user of serious caveats
that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's reference entry (e.g., man TEMPLATE) provides board-specific
information necessary to run VxWorks.  The target reference entry should be
read fully before this BSP is used.
