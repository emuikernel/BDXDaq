Apology

a. There is a description that WIDE dhcp supports FreeBSD, but it is
   sample implementation.  We have no machine which runs FreeBSD, when
   we try to test our implementation. So we only confirm that they can
   be compiled.

b. We have not done enough tests yet, so please send us bug report.
