1. How to Compile and Install

Please enter the following command.  The dhcp server named dhcps will
be created.

   SONY NEWS-OS;		make OSTYPE=news
   BSD/386 1.1;			make OSTYPE=oldbsdi
   BSD/OS 2.0.1;		make OSTYPE=bsdos
   SunOS 4.1.4;			make OSTYPE=sunos4
   FreeBSD;			make OSTYPE=FreeBSD

Please copy dhcps to appropriate appropriate directory such as
/usr/etc for SunOS and NEWS-OS, /usr/sbin for BSD/OS and FreeBSD.
dhcps can be executed from "/etc/rc.local", if you want to do so.

Next, please add following two lines to /etc/services.  But the dhcps
works correctly whether or not you will do so.

	dhcps           67/udp                          # dhcp server
	dhcpc           68/udp                          # dhcp client

The dhcps prints out error messages to syslog with LOG_LOCAL0
facility.  Please add following description to syslog.conf if you
want. (This is optional configuration and isn't required to operate).
Actual description for each OS may have subtle differences.

	local0.*			/var/log/dhcplog


2. Usage

The set of IP addresses managed by the server is called an address
pool.  And the DHCP client can't communicate with the DHCP server
which is on another subnet.  The relay agent enables interaction
between the server and client in such environment.

The server requires two databases; One is /etc/dhcpdb.pool to describe
the address pool, and other is /etc/dhcpdb.relay to describe
information about relay agent.  A file "/etc/dhcpdb.bind" will be
created by the server to manage information about address assignments,
but basically you don't have to edit this file.

After you've written these two configuration files, you can start
dhcps.  Please refer manual and README included in ../db_sample to
know more detail about how to use and configure server.
