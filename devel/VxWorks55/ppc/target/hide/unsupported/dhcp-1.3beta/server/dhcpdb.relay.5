.SH NAME
.B dhcpdb.relay
\- database which lists relay agents
.SH DESCRIPTION
When the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server receives an
address assignment request from client via a relay agent,
.B dhcpdb.relay
is used to retrieve the subnet number for the client.  Requests forwarded
from a relay agent which isn't described in this database are ignored.
.LP
.B dhcpdb.relay
is configured as set of lines.  Each line contains the IP address of a
relay agent and its subnet number, separated by spaces or tabs.  Both values 
must be in the "dotted decimal" format used by
.BR inet_addr (3).
.LP
The database should not include the IP address of any relay agents on the
same subnet as the DHCP server. Unpredictable behavior will result.
.LP
The relay agent attempts to send DHCP messages to the IP address of the server 
from which it receives the message.  So the IP address described in
.B dhcpdb.relay
also should be the IP address which the relay agent handles.  If the
relay agent handles multiple network interfaces, each corresponding IP 
address must be specified in this file.
