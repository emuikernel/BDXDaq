.SH NAME
.B dhcpdb.pool
\- DHCP Server configurations database
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcpdb.pool
is a database which includes parameters managed by the DHCP (Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol) server such as the IP address, subnet mask, and 
so on.  When the server receives a request for a new address assignment,
it searches this database to select an IP address.  In order to use manual
(static) allocation, you must specify the client ID in the address entry.
.LP
The server also maintains a database
.B dhcpdb.bind
which manages bindings.  It is used to store the client ID with the currently 
assigned entry of the address pool database.
.LP
There is only one entry per line in
.BR dhcpdb.pool ,
but this limit may be avoided by putting a backslash(\\) at the end of a line.
Each entry consists of a set of fields separated by colons(:).
.LP
The first field of the line is a label of up to four characters, which is 
stored as the last field of
.BR dhcpdb.bind .
The remaining fields take the form <tag>=<value>, and are described further
in the following section.
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS 
.SS Value Types 
The following types may be used in field entries:
.TP 12
.I bool
This takes values of "true" or "false". An unrecognized value defaults to 
false.  
(ex. ipfd=true)
.TP
.I str
This takes a character string as a value.  If the string includes a delimiter
character like a colon, it should be enclosed in quotation marks.
(ex. hstn="clapton")
.TP
.I octet
8 bit integer in decimal, octal, or hex.  
(cf. 8, -1, 070, 0xff)
.TP
.I short
16 bit integer.
.TP
.I long
32 bit integer.
.TP
.I ip
This type interprets its value as a 32 bit IP address. One of the following
formats is expected: a.b.c.d, a.b.c or a.b.  In the second format, c is 
interpreted as a 16 bit value. In the third format, b is interpreted as a
24 bit value. (ex. ipad=10.0.0.1)
.TP
.I iplist
This takes a list of IP addresses, separated by whitespace. 
(ex. rout=133.4.31.1 133.4.31.2 133.4.31.3)
.TP
.I ippairs
This takes a list of IP address pairs.  Each IP address is separated by 
whitespace and grouped in pairs.  
(ex. strt=133.4.27.0 133.4.31.1 133.4.36.0 133.4.31.1)
.TP
.I mtpt
This type takes a list of 16 bit integers, separated by whitespace.  
(ex. mtpt=1 2 3 4 6 8)
.TP
.I clid
This takes a client identifier as a value.  Client identifiers are represented
by the quoted string "<type>:<data>", where <type> is an integer from 0 to 255,
as defined by the IANA, and <data> is a sequence of 8-bit values in hex.
The client ID is usually a MAC address.    
(ex. clid="1:0x08004600e5d5")
.LP
.if n .ig GO
.SS Codes
In the following table, the code column contains the option number as defined 
in RFC 1533, if any. Tags whose meaning is not described in that document are
indicated by the '-' character.
.SS Inclusion from previous entries
The "tblc" tag includes previous entries according to the following rules:
.TP 3
\(bu
Undefined values take the value of the quoted entry, but defined values
are not overwritten.
.TP
\(bu
Quotations are processed in order so that fields in later quotations will
not replace the values from earlier quoted entries. To avoid confusion,
using the same tag within several quoted entries is not recommended.
.TP
\(bu
Specific fields included from a quoted entry may be removed by including the 
field name followed by the "@" character after the quotation. Excessive use of 
this feature is not recommended. Example: snmk@ to remove a quoted subnet mask
value.

Name	Code	Type	Description
.sp .6v
tblc	-	str	Quotation from another entry.
snam	-	str	Name of DHCP server.
file	-	str	Name of file containing boot image.
siad	-	ip	Address of tftp server which offers
			boot image.
albp	-	bool	If true, this entry is also available
			to BOOTP clients. For entries using
			static allocation, this value becomes 
			true by default and maxl becomes 
			infinity.
ipad	-	ip	IP address to be allocated.
maxl	-	long	Maximum lease duration in seconds.  The
			default value is 3600 secs which is
			defined in database.h.
dfll	-	long	Default lease duration in seconds. If a
			client does not request a specific lease
			duration, the server uses this value. The 
			default value is 3600, defined in database.h.
clid	-	clid	This specifies a client identifier for
			static allocation.  The WIDE version
			client uses a MAC address as client
			identifier, so a MAC address should
			be provided here.	
snmk	1	ip	Subnet mask of the IP address to be
			allocated.  The default is a natural mask
			corresponding to the IP address. The
			WIDE project server will not issue IP
			addresses to clients on different subnets.

rout	3	iplist	A list of routers on the same subnet as 
			the client.
