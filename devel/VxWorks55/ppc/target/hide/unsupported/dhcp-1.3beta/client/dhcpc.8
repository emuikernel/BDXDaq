.TH DHCPC 8 "28 February 1995"
.SH NAME
.B dhcpc
\- DHCP client (finite state machine version)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcpc
[
.B \-d
]
.I interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcpc
is a client of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
.B dhcpc
requests the DHCP server to allocate an IP address for the specified
.IR interface .
And usually there is an expire date, which is called a lease, with the
allocated address.  But
.B dhcpc
automatically tries to extend the lease before an expiration date comes.
.LP
On the basis of RFC, when
.B dhcpc
is invoked after rebooting,
.B dhcpc
requests server to assign the same address as before.
To get the same address,
.B dhcpc
creates file named "/etc/dhcp_cache".  This file name could be
configured when it is compiled.  But it is required that the file must
remains after the host reboot.  For example, the /tmp directory is not
appropriate for this purpose.
.LP
If the
.B \-d
option is specified,
.B dhcpc
runs in foreground and debugging mode.
.LP
The DHCP client can verify whether its assigned information is still
valid at any time.
.B dhcpc
verifies when it receives
.B SIGUSR1.
If the client needs to get a new address as a result of verification,
.B dhcpc
will do so automatically.
.LP
On the basis of RFC, the DHCP client may release its assigned address
to the server before shutdown.
So if
.B dhcpc
receives
.BR SIGUSR2 ,
it tries to send 
.B DHCPRELEASE
to the server once and does necessary process to finish its operation.
.LP
.B dhcpc
will finish after the resetting network interface when it receives
.B SIGTERM
or
.BR SIGINT .
