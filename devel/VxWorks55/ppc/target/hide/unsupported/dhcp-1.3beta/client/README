1. How to Compile and Install

Please enter the following command.  The DHCP client named dhcpc will
be created.

   SONY NEWS-OS;		make OSTYPE=news
   BSD/386 1.1;			make OSTYPE=oldbsdi
   BSD/OS 2.0.1;		make OSTYPE=bsdos
   SunOS 4.1.4;			make OSTYPE=sunos4
   FreeBSD;			make OSTYPE=FreeBSD

Please copy dhcpc to appropriate appropriate directory such as
/usr/etc for SunOS and NEWS-OS, /usr/sbin for BSD/OS and FreeBSD.
dhcpc can be executed from "/etc/rc.local", if you want to do so.

Next, please add following two lines to /etc/services.  But the client
works correctly whether or not you will do this, because the client
uses default port.

	dhcps           67/udp                          # dhcp server
	dhcpc           68/udp                          # dhcp client

The client prints out error messages to syslog with LOG_LOCAL0
facility.  Please add following description to syslog.conf if you
want. (This is optional configuration and isn't required to operate).
Actual description for each OS may have subtle differences.

	local0.*			/var/log/dhcplog


2. How to use the client

Please enter the following command as root.

	dhcpc [-d] interface_name

The "-d" option will make the client to run in the debug mode.  If
there isn't any option, the client runs in the daemon mode.  You
should not specify "-d" option when you execute it from /etc/rc.local.

Please refer to "dhcpc.8" for more detail.
