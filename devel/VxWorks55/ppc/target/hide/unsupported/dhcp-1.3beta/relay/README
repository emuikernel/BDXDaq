This directory includes WIDE version DHCP relay agent.  DHCP relay
agent is designed to be compatible with BOOTP relay agent, so our
implementation can be used with BOOTP.  We confirm that it runs on
BSD/386 1.1, BSD/OS 2.0.1, NEWS-OS 4.2, SunOS 4.1.4, FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.

1. How to Compile and Install

Please enter the following command.  The relay agent named relay will
be created.

   SONY NEWS-OS;		make OSTYPE=news
   BSD/386 1.1;			make OSTYPE=oldbsdi
   BSD/OS 2.0;			make OSTYPE=bsdos
   SunOS;			make OSTYPE=sunos4
   FreeBSD;			make OSTYPE=FreeBSD

Please copy relay to appropriate appropriate directory such as
/usr/etc for SunOS and NEWS-OS, /usr/sbin for BSD/OS and FreeBSD.
relay can be executed from "/etc/rc.local", if you want to do so.

Next, please add following two lines to /etc/services.  But the relay
agent works correctly whether or not you will do so.

	dhcps           67/udp                          # dhcp server
	dhcpc           68/udp                          # dhcp client

The relay agent prints out error messages to syslog with LOG_LOCAL0
facility.  Please add following description to syslog.conf if you
want. (This is optional configuration and isn't required to operate).
Actual description for each OS may have subtle differences.

	local0.*			/var/log/dhcplog


2. Usage

The relay agent needs a configuration file which lists DHCP servers.
If you doesn't specify the configuration file with "-f" option, the
relay agent reads default file, "/etc/dhcpdb.server".  Please refer to
dhcpdb.server.5 and README included in ../db_sample to know how to
write the configuration file.

Please enter the following command as root.

	relay [-d] [-f server-db] interface1 [interface2 ...]

Please refer to "relay.8" for more detail.
