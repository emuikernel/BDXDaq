    (Q) I can't find the file sl.h, where the heck is it?

    (A) The file sl.h is automatically created by config(8).


    (Q) Is there a general mailing list for CSLIP?

    (A) No; in particular, cslip@ee.lbl.gov is an internal implementors
	mailing list. However, there are two Usenet newsgroups of
	interest; comp.protocols.ppp and comp.protocols.tcp-ip.


    (Q) I'm running SunOS on a Sparc and sliplogin doesn't exit when
	the connection goes down. What's wrong?

    (A) You problem need to change the eeprom configuration of the port
	you're using to support modem control. If you are using the "a"
	port, it should look like:

	    ttya-rts-dtr-off=false
	    ttya-ignore-cd=true

	If it doesn't, use eeprom(8) to change it.


    (Q) Does CSLIP run on Solaris, Ultrix, HP-UX or AIX?

    (A) Not at this time but it shouldn't be too difficult to port the
	code to these platforms. If you get CSLIP up on one of these,
	please send a copy of the changes to cslip@ee.lbl.gov!
