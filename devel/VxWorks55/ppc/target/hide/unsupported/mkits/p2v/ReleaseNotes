Version 1.2 -- February 04, 1997
-------------------------------

New features:

   Timer object table.  This feature is for those who want 
   timer id's to be indices into a static table.  The timer id
   will be a number in the range 0 - maximum number of timers - 1.
   This feature is enabled by building the library with the
   macro P2V_USE_TIMER_ARRAY defined.  It must also be defined
   in configAll.h.  The default number of timers is 25.  To change it,
   redefine the value of P2V_MAX_TIMERS in configP2v.h and rebuild
   your vxWorks BSP.

   By default this new feature is disabled.
   When disabled, timer id's are pointers to timer objects, and the
   number of timers is unlimited.


Bugfixes:

   WaitForever condition fixed in ev_receive.  Logic bug was causing
   wait forever to do a timed wait when doing a wait-all for more
   than one event.

   Skipped unnecessary tickGet() calls in ev_receive when 
   waiting forever or getting events with the no-wait flag set.

   Cleanup of tm_* calls that send events.

   Removed unused macros from p2vLib.h

   t_restart wasn't working correctly for a task restarting itself.

   t_delete was hanging when deleted task holding a semaphore.

   Errors in Version 1.1 cleanup of ASR's -- particularly setting of
   initial task sigmask.

Version 1.1 -- January 22, 1997
-------------------------------

New features:

   Version number -- previous releases were unnumbered.

   New routine, p2vVersion -- This command prints the library 
      version number to stdout.

   Demo program, asrdemo.c.  It demos events, ASR's, semaphores,
      notepad registers, various t_* calls.

   ReleaseNotes file -- you are here.  :)

Bugfixes:

   Restarted tasks no longer lose their TCB extension.

   Tasks can now restart more than once without hanging.

   Tasks that are started locked will remain locked when restarted.

   Invalid message queue identifiers no longer give segmentation
   violations in q_ident and q_vident.

   Asynchronous signal handling simplified.  The ASEnable field removed
   from the TCB extension.

   Message queue send and broadcast are now callable from interrupt level.

   Local object table uses internal semaphore for object delete.

   Corrected value of EV_ALL flag.
