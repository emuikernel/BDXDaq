I have compiled the chat program using the options listed in the Makefile.
I should point out however, the lock file for the process is in the /usr
directory. It is my understanding that the directory base is __being__
moved to /var. If you wish to use the /var location, then make the
corresponding change to the Makefile. (It should be obvious what to change.)
