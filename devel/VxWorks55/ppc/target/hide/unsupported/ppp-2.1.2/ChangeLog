Fri May 27 12:32:56 1994  Paul Mackerras  (paulus@sirius)

	* added Linux support, thanks to Michael Callahan and Al Longyear.

	* security enhancements: check permissions on options files, check
	addresses (reject loopback and multicast), require
	/etc/ppp/options by default.

	* code from Linux port: send echo-requests and terminate the
	link if echo-replies are not received; software flow control
	option (-crtscts/xonxoff).

	* vj-max-slots and -vjccomp options.

	* bugs fixed: priority queueing on little-endian machines,
	escape-escape sequence correctly interpreted

Mon Apr 18 20:50:08 1994  Paul Mackerras  (paulus@avago)

	* Some updates to make the code conform to RFCs 1548 and 1549:
	  - implement packet abort (}~) correctly
	  - ignore LCP acks/naks/rejects etc. with the ID of the last
	    conf-req sent once we've seen a valid ack/nak/reject
	  - implemented receive asyncmap.

	* if_ppp.c: restructured to make more of the code usable by
	devices other than async tty lines.  Also implemented
	extended transmit asyncmap and checks for 7-bit lines.

	* slcompress.c and other kernel code modified so that pppd can
	tell it how many slots to use in VJ compression (so if the peer
	requests that we use fewer slots we actually do).

	* pppd: added new options: kdebug, escape, mtu, disconnect, lock.
	Added serial device locking code (stolen from chat.c and kermit).

	* Include Ultrix support.

Tue Dec 14 16:45:41 1993  Paul Mackerras  (paulus at sirius)

	* pppd has been substantially rewritten to improve security and to
	conform to RFCs 133[134].

	* numerous bugs in ppp interface code for *bsd squashed,
	particularly in mbuf handling

	* include directory renamed to net

	* pppstats moved into its own directory

	* Makefiles updated

Thu Jun 17 08:17:17 1993  Brad Parker  (brad at stemwinder)

	* Added check in if_ppp.c/pppinput() for max hdr expansion at end
	of mbuf.  this was crashing with large mtu's

	* added macro in pppd.h to effect the sa_len fix

Wed Apr 28 08:21:00 1993  Brad Parker  (brad at stemwinder)

       	* ppp_if.c; added code to free route and if structures correctly
	so unload won't panic the kernel.

Mon Apr  5 12:02:00 1993  Brad Parker  (brad at stemwinder)

       	* ppp_init.c; added sun4m conditionals

Thu Mar 25 08:23:00 1993  Brad Parker  (brad at stemwinder)

	* Added Sunos bug workaround to ppp_async.c/ppp_async_wsrv()

Fri Mar  5 13:46:48 1993  Brad Parker  (brad at stemwinder)

    	* fixed delete route to work in ipcp_down()

	* added "unload" code to ppp_init.c & ppp_if.c.  note it is
	not always safe to unload the driver as ip protocols may still
	have ptrs to the interface.

	* ppp_if.c: added ppp_busy() and ppp_unattach()

	* ppp_async.c: added SIOCGIFDEBUG, SIOCSIFDEBUG ioctl's to allow
	turning the debug flags on and off (since we have no symbols to
	use kadb).  fixed bugs in SIOCSIFASYNCMAP which caused bad result
	even when ioctl worked.

	* chat.c: no longer messes with "c_flag" as this is the job
	of pppd.

	* main.c: don't set flow control before calling "connect" script.

Thu Mar  4 05:25:23 1993  Brad Parker  (brad@faster.fcr.com)

	* Oh my.  I'm suprised anyone ever got this working on 386bsd.
	Well, I installed all the patched in the 386bsd dir relative to the
	"patchkit 0.2.1" version of 386bsd.  I renamed things to be a bit
	more 386bsd-ised.  This release is for sunos 4.1.x and 386bsd 0.1
	only.  I cleaned up chat a little and made it log to syslog.  I
	cleaned up pppd a little (a very little) and got it to work with
	386bsd 0.1.  Some mods to the fsm and ipcp for better logging and
	to hang up the phone on failed connections.

	* chat.c made log to syslog, use termios

	* ipcp.c not negotiates both the new and old addresses.  It
	appears to use the correct addresses now when bringing up the
	interface. 

	* fsm.c improved logging slightly.  added max # of config
	requests.

	* cleaned up the "386bsd" directory to match the latest version of
	386bsd 0.1.  Added final files as well as context diffs.

	* fixed up makefiles to clean and install. added "safecopy" script

Sat Jan  2 23:37:40 1993  Brad Parker  (brad at stemwinder.fcr.com)

	* Added modload code from Benson Margulies <benson@odi.com>
	Makes installation on SunOS 4.x much simpler

Tue Jun 23 11:48:30 1992  Brad Parker  (brad at haiti)

	* changed pppstats.c to work with SunOS kvm lib

	* remerged all the files with the "sun" version. Compiled and
	tested on both SunOS 4.1.1 and 386BSD 0.0.

	* moved the release dirs all around to be a bit cleaner. Updated
	the makefiles and man page. Added some scripts to test, debug.

	* changed ipcp.c to default to new RFC1132 tcp compression codes.

	* added DTR raise/lower code to hangup the modem

	* changed main.c to set baud rate before calling connect script

	* fixed the "setsid()" code in main.c to work under 386BSD
	(believe it or not, the SunOS setsid() is lax and works when when
	an POSIX compliant implementation (386BSD) will not).

	* ported if_ppp.c from old 4.2 to new "4.3+" under 386BSD. Added
	lots of debugging code. Changed the mbuf code around to match new
	mbuf. Changed serial code to use new ring buffers. Added VJ tcp
	compression code.  Cleaned up ioctls to be a bit more consistant.

Sun Jun 14 05:49:27 1992  Brad Parker  (brad@jost)

	* started with pppd-1.01beta, reoriganized the dir tree
	removed all references to STREAMS
	changed "slstats" into "pppstats", using kvm_xxxx routines
	created "ppp.h" and "pppd.h" as separate header files

Fri Jan 31 15:18:21 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* Release 1.01beta

	* Fix typo in chat.c.

	* Rename ppp.8 to pppd.8.

Thu Jan 30 15:27:03 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* Release 1.0beta

	* Update ppp.8, Readme.streams, and Makefile for release.

	* changed PPP_LOG definition to be LOG_DAEMON unless any debug
	code is turned on, then its LOG_LOCAL2

Wed Jan 29 10:28:28 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* main.c, ppp.h, lcp.c, ipcp.c: fixed problem with route deletion
	on hangup

	* main.c:  changed code for obtaining remote user/passwd from a
	user-specified file instead of stdin

	* main.c:  Added code to io() to ignore non-input ready SIGIO's

	* ppp_async.c: fixed bug reported by Marc Bocher (marc@cam.org) in
	INPUT_ERROR macro that sent IF_INPUT_ERRORs in the wrong direction.

Thu Jan 23 13:16:34 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)
	* main.c: fixed pid file code to remove file on exit

	* main.c, ipcp.c, ppp.h: Added support for allowing a user to set
	the netmask on the ppp interface.  Thanks to Brad Parker
	(brad@cayman.com) for the SIFMASK code.

Wed Jan 15 23:50:22 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* ppp.h:  add multi-include protection, add definition for LOG_PPP
	(defaults to LOG_LOCAL2)

	* main.c: change syslog destination to LOG_PPP

Tue Jan 14 17:01:56 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* main.c, lcp.c, fsm.c, chap.c, upap.c, ipcp.c:  changed debug
	code to use syslog instead of stderr

Fri Jan 10 01:59:03 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* main.c, fsm.c, chap.c, upap.c: got rid of packet buffer memory
	allocation/freeing in favor of fixed input and output buffers.

Thu Jan  9 16:44:27 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* slstats.c: Added #ifdef for sun3x to use pte_pfn instead of
	pg_pfnum in klseek().  Thanks to William Korb
	(korb@mustang.cray.com) for the fix.

Sun Jan  5 16:34:55 1992  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* ppp_async.c: changed the input_debug code to use the value of
	ppp_async_input_debug for the maximum number of bytes to dump.
	I.e., if ppp_async_debug is zero, nothing is dumped, if it is
	1500, up to 1500 bytes are dumped.

Sun Dec 15 23:03:23 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* chap.c: is done! ... but does it work?

Tue Dec 10 22:04:02 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* main.c: added code to get host name to use for authentication "name",
	also added a new command "domain" which will append the given
	string to the hostname, i.e., foo -> foo.cyberdyne.com

Sun Dec  8 20:50:58 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* main.c: changed code to call cleanup() on exit which should
	try to do a graceful shutdown.

	* main.c: fixed spurious I_FLUSH error logging problem during quit.
	I_FLUSH should return ENXIO if carrier is gone, but, due to a
	typo, returns EINVAL instead.  Thanks to Greg Onufer
	(exodus@cheers.eng.sun.com) for the info.

Tue Dec  3 10:29:26 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* main.c: add typedef for pid_t for SUNOS versions prior to 4.1

Wed Nov 20 14:37:52 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* lcp.c: finished adding chap stuff to lcp.c, now onto chap.c

Mon Nov  4 11:42:30 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* ppp_async.c: added hex frame-level dump to ppp_async.c.
	this is enabled by setting the kernel variable
	ppp_async_input_debug to a non-zero value. 


Wed Oct 30 16:58:18 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* fsm.[ch], ipcp.[ch], upap.[ch]: added prototypes and fixed scoping 

Mon Oct 28 17:42:47 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* ppp.h, main.c, magic.[ch], lcp.[ch]: added prototypes and
	fixed scoping  

Fri Oct 25 12:17:53 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)
	* rename executable from "ppp" to "pppd" and "ppp.c" to "main.c"

	* main.c: added "connect" option to invoke a shell as the real uid with
	the specified command.  this is useful for invoking the "chat"
	program directly from pppd.

	* locally scoped many functions in "main.c"

Thu Oct 24 18:03:30 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* made lots of changes to minimize type mismatches (benign or
	otherwise).  made local copy of callout.h so that generic pointers
	to functions can be used in callouts.  changed timeout callbacks
	in fsm.c and upap.c to use a caddr_t as the argument and in the
	timeout callback function recast back to a pointer to the local
	struct type. 

Wed Oct 23 14:35:04 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* INSTALL/chat.c: Modified chat.c to add code to save/restore
	of TTY params per suggestion of Jim Mayer (mayer@wrc.xerox.com)

	* ppp.c: Added various #includes to define function types that
	were previously defaulting to type int.

	* ppp.c: Fixed nasty bug reported by Jim Mayer (mayer@wrc.xerox.com) 
	alrm() where it was possible to dereference callout when it was
	NULL

	* ppp.c: Added real setsid() support based on a patch from Jim Mayer

	* ppp.c: Fixed another bug pointed out by Jim Meyer. In login() 
	user and passwd strings have nulls appended to them
	without first making copies. Needless to say, this is not a good
	idea.  Used alloca() to make copies before adding the null.


Mon Oct 21 17:16:34 1991  Greg Christy  (gmc at premises1.Quotron.COM)

	* Initialize ChangeLog

	* ppp_if.c: Add NIT interface from Juha Sarlin
	  (juha@elixir.lne.kth.se)

	* Makefile: Add saber dependencies
