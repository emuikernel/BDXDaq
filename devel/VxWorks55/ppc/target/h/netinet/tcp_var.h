--------------------
01g,05jun02,vvv  replaced TF_PREV_SMALL with TF_EOB (SPR #72213)
01f,06mar02,vvv  added new flag TF_PREV_SMALL (SPR #72213)
01e,10oct01,rae  merge from truestack ver 01f, base 01c
01d,10nov00,spm  merged from version 01d of tor3_x branch (SPR #31996 fix)
01c,31mar97,vin  added changes for pcb hashlookups.
01b,30oct96,vin  changed tcp_template to mbuf from tcp_iphdr so that dtom
		 wont be necessary.
