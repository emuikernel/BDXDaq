Unfortunately CODA seems to be a popular name and web search engines turn up a whole host of CODA web sites. If
you are interested in the common data acquisition environment for Physics experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility, then you are in the right place.</P>

			<H2>Introduction</H2>
			<P>In the early days (i.e. before I got here in 1991) it was decided that data acquisition was an important enough
			field that it merited it's own support group charged with providing the laboratory with a &quot;state of the art&quot;
			data acquisition environment which would be common to all experiments and test systems through the laboratory.</P>

			<P>The data acquisition group was founded by John Domingo, then associate director of Physics Division. The first
			group leader was Chip Watson. Chip's wife taught piano and when we were looking for a name for the system Chip
			thought of CODA. Originally CODA was an acronym, <I>C</I>EBAF <I>O</I>nline <I>D</I>ata <I>A</I>cquisition, but
			when the laboratory was renamed we decided to keep the name CODA.

<P>The original CODA manual was a paper manual written using &quot;Framemaker<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">&reg;</FONT></SUP>&quot;
this manual was very hard to maintain. The new manual is in the form of web pages which are linked to from the
