The files fbconfig.o and ts2config.o are generated from code
in the primex CVS repository here:

Root: /u/group/primex/CVS_REPOSITORY
Repository: src/programs/DAQ/crl

They are used to provide additional functionality for
modifying settings in the Trigger Supervisor and Fastbus
crates used in PrimEx.
