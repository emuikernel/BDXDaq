### Version 1.1 of the Universe Driver now supports Kernel Versions 2.4...

Check www.vmelinux.org for examples of Interrupts and DMA transfers.

What you find here are files that will allow the Linux Kernel access to the
VMEbus in computers that use the Tundra Universe CA91C042 PCI-VME bridge chip.
Used by many processor manufacturers, the Universe is a proven performer
in VME bus access.

The whole set of files is brought to you under the terms of the
GNU General Public license.  A copy is with these files as GPL.

This version of the VMELinux Utilites will only work with the 2.2.x and 2.4.x 
Linux kernels due to the many changes in kernel structure since 2.0.x.  Also,
you must have the GNU 2.8.x or newer compiler.

Please keep in mind that GCC 3.0 is a major change from GCC 2.95 compilers.  
There maybe problems with using GCC 3.0 but it does seem to work on our 
systems.

Yes, we do interrupts.  The Universe driver installs as a kernel module making
its functions available to other kernel modules.  User mode interrupts are not
supported.  Very soon an example program will be available to show all of you
how to deal with VME interrupts using the Universe ca91c042 driver.  Please
visit the VMELinux Project web site www.vmelinux.org and join the email list
to keep up with the latest developments.

The VMELinux Project works on:

Dynatem DPC1,
SBS Or Computer VP7,
XyCom

and other processors.  As we test more boards we will list compatible models
on the web site.
