README for vmeinterrupt
July 28, 2005  David Lawrence


This is the source for a kernel module used to implement
user-space interrupts in conjunction with the ca91c042 Universe
driver.

This is a pretty minimal module. It just registers an interrupt
service routine (ISR) and wakes the wait queue set up in the
ca91c042 module. This means the ca91c042 module must be inserted
into the kernel before the vmeinterrupt module is.
