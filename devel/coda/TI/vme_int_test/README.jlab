README for vme_int_test
July 28, 2005  David Lawrence


This program is used along with the ti_pulser program to
demonstrate the user-space interrupts of provided by
the vmeinterrupt and ca91c042 kernel modules. The ca91c042
is the Universe chip driver for MVME5500, MVME5100 and 
possibly earlier boards.

To use this, one should have a JLab designed VME Trigger
interface board installed. 

1.) Connect output pin 0 should be connected to input pin 0.

2.) Start the vme_int_test program (no arguments)

3.) Start the ti_pulser program (no arguments)

If all is working well, the EXT, TRG, and ACK lights should
all be on.

Both the vme_int_test and ti_pulser program communicate
through device files like:

name:         major:  minor:
------------  ------  ------
/dev/vme_ctl    221     8
/dev/vme_m0     221     0
/dev/vme_m1     221     1
.
.
.

They must exist with the proper major/minor device numbers and
they must have rw permissions set.
