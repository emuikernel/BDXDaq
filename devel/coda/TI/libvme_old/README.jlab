README.jlab   libvme

David Lawrence May 26,2005


This is the C++ API for communicating with the VME bus
via the ca91c042 Universe driver ala /dev/vme_*. This
came with the ca91c042 driver package.

The only real modification I made was to the Makefile.
I prefered to have statically linked executables so
added libvme.a target and made it the deafault.

I'm putting here in our repository since some of our
software will rely on it and development on it seems
to have stopped 3 1/2 years ago.
