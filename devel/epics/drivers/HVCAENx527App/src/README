Acknowledgements
----------------
Thanks to Burkhard Kolb (GSI) for testing, and debugging the multiple
crate aspect of the IOC application, and for debugging and patching
the device parser code.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you find that you cannot restart the application, check the
output and see if it complains about a semaphore already in
use.  If so, run the 'ipcs' command to find the semaphore
ID and Key (you only need the ID, but the key is often more
convenient IF your version of 'ipcs' and 'ipcrm' supports it).
Then use the 'ipcrm' command to delete the semaphore.  One
of these days, I'll add code to manage this automatically.

To Do
-----
- see if you can build param lists external to scan, so that scan
   routine doesn't have to keep rebuilding them.  This could reduce
   CPU usage significantly.  Put lists in CrateScanList[] as 2D array.
- scan period has been assigned for each Param for future use. 
   Eventually, consider either:
   - cycling through list every server scan period.  This means
      building a param-based scan list at initialization is impossible.
   OR
   - building a list of customized param scan periods, and manage
      the list as the user changes them.  That is, if the user
      makes the period non-standard for one PV, it is added to
      a separate list; a separate timeout check from the 3 standard
      ones will deal with grabbing single channel data and then
      posting to the PV; then when the user dials it back to the
      standard, it is taken off the list.
- Make readout of some Params user triggered (i.e. not periodic,
   using manual update button/trigger PV)?  Reset all timers, too?
- PV for server scan times
- PVs for board parameters (esp. HVMax)
- PVs for system/crate parameters (esp. FanStat, debug level)
- add parameter properties (e.g. min and/or max)
- make PVs go undefined when connection lost
- make output PVs update if value at crate changes
- bounds checking on deltav, perhaps 0 to 50
- change device address scheme to follow de facto standard
- need to improve trapping of crashes so that the semaphore
   key can be cleared
- interlocks: if an external PV fails criterion, shut down channel
- improve IP-to-string conversion
