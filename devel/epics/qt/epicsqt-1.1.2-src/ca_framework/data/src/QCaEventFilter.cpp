/* Description:
 *
 * Manage an event filter to catch events posted from within the
 * QCaObject by the CA callback thread (using the QCaObject::signalCallback().
 *
 * This is part of the mechanism for translating a foreign-thread callback
 * from a CaObject to a Qt signal from a QCaObject.
 *
 * A QObject is supplied by the creator of a QCaObject object. An event filter
 * is added to this object to catch events posted by the QCaObject object in the
 * context of a foreign thread.
 * See the description of QCaObject (in QCaObject.cpp) for details of the entire
 * data update process and where the event filters managed by this class fit
 * in to the process.
 *
 * Only a single static instance of this class is required.
 * Multiple QCaObjects can be created specifying the same event handling object,
 * but the event filter should only be added once. A list is maintained of
 * what event objects a filter has been added to and maintains a reference
 * count of how many QCaObjects are relying on it processing events for that object.
 *
 * Typically the number of event objects used by an application to process QCaObject events
 * will be small. Examples are:
 *  - A single object processing all data updates
 *  - One object (on one thread) for general updates and another for special updates
 *    requiring extensive processing
 *  - An object (on it's own thread) for each CPU to maximise the machine utilisation.
 *
 * Note, if an event has been posted by a QCaObject and the QCaObject is deleted before
 * the event is processed, the event will still be processed if the event filter is
 * still in place - and the filter will still be there if any other QCaObjects are using
 * the same QObject to process events. In this case the event will reference a QCaObject
 * which no longer exists. This case is not managed here. Refer to the QCaObject destructor to see how
 * this potentially dangerous situation is dealt with.
 *
 * This class is thread safe
