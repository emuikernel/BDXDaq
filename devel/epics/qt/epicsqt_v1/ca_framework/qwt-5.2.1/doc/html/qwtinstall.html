============

Qwt uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to 
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix <span class="stringliteral">&quot;*.pro&quot;</span>. 
Files that end with the suffix <span class="stringliteral">&quot;*.pri&quot;</span> are included by the project 
files and contain definitions, that are common <span class="keywordflow">for</span> several project files.

qwtconfig.pri is read by all project files of the Qwt package.
So the first step is to edit qwtconfig.pri to adjust it to your
needs.

MathML Extension
================

Qwt/Qt4 supports the MathML render engine from the Qt solutions package,
that is only available with a commercial Qt license.

You need a release of qtmmlwidget &gt;= 2.1.
Copy the files qtmmlwidget.[cpp|h] to textengines/mathml.

Documentation
==========================

Qwt includes a <span class="keyword">class </span>documentation, that is available in various formats:

- Html files
- PDF document 
- Qt Compressed Help (*.qch ) for the Qt assistant or creator. 
  You can load it &quot;Edit Preferences&quot; -&gt; &quot;Documentation&quot; -&gt; &quot;Add...&quot;
- Man pages ( UNIX only )

A) Unix Qt3/Qt4
==========================

qmake
make
make install

If you have installed a shared library it&#39;s path has to be known to 
the run-time linker of your operating system. On Linux systems read
&quot;man ldconfig&quot; ( or google for it ). Another option is to use
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on some systems LIBPATH is used instead, on MacOSX
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) environment variable.

If you only want to check the Qwt examples without installing something,
you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory 
of your local build. 

If you didn&#39;t enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake 
make


B) Win32/MSVC Qt3/Qt4
=====================

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e MSVC with nmake:
qmake qwt.pro
nmake

If you didn&#39;t enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
nmake

admin/msvc-qmake.bat helps users of Visual Studio users to
generate makefiles or project files (.dsp for MSVC-6.0 or vcproj for 
MSVC.NET) for Qwt.

To generate makefiles, type: &quot;admin\msvc-qmake&quot;
To generate project files, type: &quot;admin\msvc-qmake vc&quot;

When you have built a Qwt DLL you need to add the following
define to your compiler flags: QWT_DLL.

Windows doesn&#39;t like mixing of debug and release binaries. Most
of the problems with using the Qwt designer plugin are because
of trying to load a Qwt debug library into a designer release 
executable.


C) Win32/MinGW Qt4
==================

C1) Windows Shell

Start a Windows Shell, where Qt4 is initialized. ( F.e. with
&quot;Programs-&gt;Qt by Trolltech ...-&gt;Qt 4.x.x Command Prompt&quot; ).

qmake qwt.pro
make

If you didn&#39;t enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
make
make install

C2) MSYS Shell Qt &gt;= 4.3.0

Support for the MSYS Shell has been improved in Qt 4.3.0. 
Now building Qwt from the MSYS Shell works exactly like in UNIX or in the 
Windows Shell - or at least it should:
because of a bug in Qt 4.3.0 you always have to do a &quot;qmake -r&quot;.

C3) MSYS Shell Qt &lt; 4.3.0

For Qt &lt; 4.3.0 you have to set the MINGW_IN_SHELL variable. 
make will run into errors with the subdirs target, that can be 
ignored (make -i).

export MINGW_IN_SHELL=1;

qmake 
make -i
make -i install

If you didn&#39;t enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
make -i
make -i install

C1-C3)

When you have built a Qwt DLL you need to add QWT_DLL to your compiler 
flags. If you are using qmake for your own builds this done by adding 
the following line to your profile: &quot;DEFINES += QWT_DLL&quot;.

Windows doesn&#39;t like mixing of debug and release binaries. Most
of the problems with using the Qwt designer plugin are because
of trying to load a Qwt debug library into a designer release 
executable.

D) MacOSX

Well, the Mac is only another Unix system. So read the instructions in A).

In the recent Qt4 releases the default target of qmake is to generate
XCode project files instead of makefiles. So you might need to do the
following:

qmake -spec macx-g++
...

D) Qtopia Core

I only tested Qwt with Qtopia Core in qvfb (Virtual Framebuffer Devivce)
Emulator on my Linux box. To build Qwt for the emulator was as simple as 
for a regular Unix build.

qmake
make

E) Qtopia (!= Qtopia Core)

I once compiled the Qwt library against Qtopia 4.2.0 successfully - but
not more. It should be possible to build and install Qwt, but it&#39;s
not done yet.

Good luck !
