Revision history for Perl extension Device::SerialPort.

1.2.0 2004-11-09 (Kees)
	* configure.ac: corrected version number here too.
	* SerialPort.pm: added wait_modemlines, intr_count.
	* SerialPort.xs, configure.ac: added TIOCMIWAIT, TIOCGICOUNT
	* white space cleanups.

1.0.2 2004-05-10 (Kees)
	* Makefile.PL: added an OSX serial port default
	* SerialPort.pm: patch for EOF handling by Arne Georg Gleditsch.
	  On a read for more than 0 bytes, and "select" finishes, but
          we get a 0 back, then we assume EOF.
	* corrected version in .spec file.

1.0.1 2004-03-29 (Kees)
	* small typo in bits processing for can_ioctl (thanks to
	  Rick Ballard and John Eng for finding this!)

1.0.0 2004-02-23 (Kees)
	* fixed logic in READ tie function from Jaakko Yli-Luukko	
	* added RPM .spec packaging support
	* adding debian packaging support
	* updated version number to first stable release
	* fixing up failure return codes in data,parity,flow functions
	* cleaning up default settings for parmrk, istrip, etc
	* split off stty_parmrk
	* setting defaults of 9600, 8N1, no flow in "new"
	* added MS_DTR_ON and MS_DSR_ON
	* clearly documenting "carrier" bit
	* added automatic system baud rate detection
	* added modem line reporting to "modemtest"
	* documented "modemtest"
	* I think I finally found the parity problem that has been
	  plauging this code since I took it over!

0.22 2003-06-18 (Kees)
	* added a notice about 4096 read limits on some machines
	  noticed by Ed Morandi.
	* built an rpm .spec file with the help of cpan2rpm.
	* adding TESTPORT=... as a Makefile.PL option to not step on
          MakeMaker's feet.
	* making "modemtest" an installable script (which adds #! to top).
	* cleaning up "modemtest" args and output.
	* reversing configure report so "best" case reports "yes" for all.
	* handling ancient libcs with odd POSIX.pm _SC_CLK_TCK behavior
	  with diagnostic help from David Dyck
	* added test case explicitly for get_tick_count

0.21 2003-06-12 (Kees)
	* don't release files at midnight any more: forgot SerialPort.xs

0.20 2003-06-12 (Kees)
        * fixed some truth bugs found by David Dyck <david.dyck@fluke.com>
	* totally rewrote serial bit detection code to use "normal"
          perl XS routines.  Had to even toss in a "configure" script
          to make it really robust.
	* jumped up to version 0.20 just because it's just a big change
          to the build process.  Everything else appears undisturbed, but
          I want to give some time for testing it out on other
          architectures.

0.13 2002-05-31 (Kees)
	* added 'sys/modem.ph' for broken HPUX headers
        * fixed *BSD tiocmget and tick counts, care of
                joerg_wunsch@interface-systems.de
        * fixed the HPUX tioc* stuff, care of
                "Chang, Jerry" <Jerry.Chang@pyxis.com>

0.12 2001-10-24 (Kees)
	* found a place where HANDLE was staying open

	* added FILENO function, per James Mitchell's suggestion
	* detecting vmin settings for broken Solaris tools.
