The VMIVME/SW-6016-ABC-030 Device Driver for VxWORKS contains the
following files:

    * atp6016.c      - Acceptance Test 'C' Source Code
    * dev6016.h      - 6016 Card Header File
    * drv6016.c      - Driver 'C' Source Code
    * drv6016.h      - Driver 'C' Header File
    * Makefile       - 6016 VxWorks Driver makefile
    * menu6016.c     - 6016 Menu Driver 'C' Source Code
    * NEWS           - Late-Breaking News and Release Notes
    * README         - This file
    * tty6016.c      - Driver 'C' Source Code for TTY Mode
    * vxsh.sh        - Shell script to establish VxWORKS environment

The Makefile should be modified with the directories and preferences
for the host machine. You may wish to examine the 'vwsh.sh' script:
it provides an easy way to define a VxWORKS development
environment.

To make the 'vxsh' script into an executable form, type:

	$ make vwsh

To make the driver, atp and menu program, type:

	$ vwsh make

This will produce the driver executable modules 'atp', 'drv' and
'menu'.

On the VxWORKS machine, load the driver in the usual VxWORKS manner,
by redirecting the standard input file of the VxWORKS loader 'ld' like
this:

	$ ld < drv

The Acceptance Test Program (ATP) may then be run. The program takes
no command line arguments:

	$ atp

To execute the Menu program just type:

	$ menu
