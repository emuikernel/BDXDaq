[HELP_ README]
	       Changes AFTER manual vers. 1.001

A  new	fitting  option  (fitting  to  a   sum	 of   Legendre
polynomials)  has  been  added. This is controlled through the
keywords (example is for curve 2)

     style curve 2 fittype legendre
     style curve 2 legendreorder 4

The ability to subtract off a  constant  background  prior  to
fitting has been added.

The keyword  "algorithm",  which  determines  how  points  are
connected, has a synonym: "connection". Thus, for example, one
can use interchangably:

     style curve 2 algorithm spline
     style curve 2 connection spline

There is an additional symbol available: bigpoint.

The following plot styles were omitted from from table	3,  or
have been added to handle the new features described above:


  keyword    |	 arguments   |	      example	     | default
------------ | ------------  | --------------------  | -------
titlecolor   | color	     | style titlecolor red  | black
xlabelcolor  | color	     | style xlabelcolor red | black
ylabelcolor  | color	     | style ylabelcolor red | black
xlog	     | Boolean	     | style xlog on	     | off
ylog	     | Boolean	     | style ylog on	     | off
legendleft   | number (DATA) | style legendleft 1.1  | ~xmin
legendtop    | number (DATA) | style legendtop 2.3   | ~ymax
vlabel	     | x, y, font,   | (see the manual	     |
	     | color, label  | entry for "label")    |
background   | number	     | style background 10.0 |
useback      | Boolean	     | style useback off     | on
showback     | Boolean	     | style showback on     | off

The "vlabel" is just a vertical version of a "label".

[HELP_File Format]

  hvplot data files are expected to have a .plt extension.
The file is delimited into plot records. Each plot record  can
contain a number of curves.

The  keywords  [PLOTREC]  and  [ENDREC],  enclosed  in	square
brackets,  delimit a plot record. Thus an hvplot .plt file has
the structure:

 !here is the first plot
 [PLOTREC]
 (plot and curve styles)
 (plot data)
 [ENDREC]

 !here is the next plot

 [PLOTREC]
 [ENDREC]

[END]

[HELP_Comments and Case]
		      Comments and Case

Comments and blanklines are permitted within  the  .plt  file.
Comments  must	have  an  exclamation  point  `!' in the first
column. No "in-line" comments  are  permitted.	Everything  in
hvplot is case insensitive.

[END]

[HELP_Plot Styles]
			 Plot Styles

Modifying plot and curve styles through the user interface has
already  been  discussed  in  chapter  2.  In  the follow- ing
sections, we discuss how those same selections can  be	placed
into  the .plt file so that the plot comes up just the way you
want.

Every plot style line is of the form

    style keyword value

All the plot and curve style lines must occur above  the  data
in  a plot record. Style lines encountered within the data are
ignored.

[END]

[HELP_Curve Counting]
			Curve Counting

Data are organized into columns. The meaning of each column is
determined  by the style order line. Using a single letter: X,
Y, D, V and H it specifies the meaning	of  the  corresponding
column.

X and Y are self explanatory. D is for	"Dummy",  which  means
"ignore".  V is for vertical error bars, H is for hor- izontal
error bars. The default is set order X Y Y Y Y...

Each Y column creates a new curve that is associated with an X
via  the  following  algorithm. Each Y uses the most recent X,
unless there isn't an X, in which case it will use the next X.
Similarly for H and V, except V uses the most recent (or waits
for the next) Y. Got it?

Here is an example:

    style order x y y d x y v h

Eight  columns	of  data  are  expected.  Three   curves   are
generated.  The  first	and  second  curve share column one as
their X data and use columns two and  three  respectively  for
their  Y data. The have no error bars. Column four is ignored.
The third curve uses columns five and  six  for  Xand  Y,  and
columns  seven	and  eight for vertical and hor- izontal error
bars.

[END]

[HELP_Continuation Plots]
		      Continuation Plots

It may often be the case that you want contiguous plot records
to share a set of axes rather than generating a new plot. This
is handled with the style continue line. Thus, a file with the
format:

     [PLOTREC]
     .
     .
     .
     [ENDREC]

     [PLOTREC]
     style continue
     .
     .
     .
     [ENDREC]

will generate only one plot, rather than two. All  the	curves
from  the  second  plot record are included in the first plot.
Continuation plots are also useful for overlaying curves  with
different numbers of data points.

Entire	files  can  be	overlaid  by  using   style   continue
mechanism,  although you must remember to choose append rather
than delete when reading the additional files.

All the plot styles  for  a  sequence  of  continuation  plots
should	occur  in  the	first  plot  record.  The  one obvious
exception: each continuation plot can have its own style order
line.  Each  continuation  plot can use the full complement of
curve styles.

[END]

[HELP_Curve Styles]
			 Curve Styles

Curve styles have the form:

    curve n style keyword value

where n refers to the number of the curve based on  the  style
order line.  Even if there is only one curve you need the "n".
A plot with a single curve will have curve style lines of  the
form:

    style curve 1 keyword value.

[END]

[HELP_Moving and Resizing Plots]
		  Moving and Resizing plots

Plots can be moved by pressing	and  holding  the  left  mouse
button	when the pointer is anywhere inside the plot, and then
dragging to the desired location. Exceptions to this rule are:
if  you  click on a "child" of the plot, such as the legend or
an annotation, you'll drag the	child  rather  than  the  plot
(which	 is  presumably  what  you  want.)  Another  exception
involves  resizing  rather  than  moving,  which  we   discuss
presently.

In each corner of a plot there is a small "resize" square.  If
you  click  (and hold) one of the resize squares with the left
mouse button, the plot can be resized. The squares  are  shown
in a light shade of gray. The squares will not appear when the
plot is printed.

[END]

[HELP_Editing Labels]
			Editing labels

To edit a label (the title,  axes  labels,  or	any  annotated
string)  double-click  on it. An editor will appear permitting
you to change the font, color, text, etc. You can  also  enter
latex-like   control  sequences  to  mix  fonts,  create  sub-
scripts, etc.

The special control sequences are initiated with a  backslash:
'\'. Here is a listing of presently recognized sequences:

 \\	the backslash character
 \n	insert a newline
 \b	change to boldface
 \p	change to plainface
 \g	change to greek (symbol)
 \r	change to roman (helvetica)
 \+	next bigger font
 \-	next smaller font
 \^	raise the baseline (superscript)
 \_	lower the baseline (subscript)
 \s	small horizontal space
 \S	large horizontal space
 \d	restore default font


[END]

[HELP_Interface Basics]
		       Interface Basics

    Single and double  clicking,  when	used  to  initiate  an
    action, is always performed with the left mouse button.

    Special  features  are  often  accessed   through	shift-
    clicking,  wherein	the  shift  key and a mouse button are
    pressed simultaneously.

    Zooming is performed with the middle mouse button.	"Drag"
    a  rectangle  (with  the middle but- ton pressed and held)
    within the axes of a plot, and that particular  plot  will
    zoom. Other plots will not be affected.

    Popup menus are accessed with the third mouse button.

    If it seems as if you should be able  to  drag  something,
    for  example the plot title, you probably can. Click on it
    with the left mouse button, keep it pressed, and drag  the
    object around.

    If it seems that some object should be "editable", such as
    the plot itself, it probably is. Double click on an object
    to bring up its editor.

    To delete objects (including plots), bring up their editor
    (by double clicking) and hit the delete button.


A political correctness alert. We use  the  term  "LEFT  mouse
button"  when we should use "mouse button 1", with full malice
of forethought and  the  realization  that  some  left-handers
(helicity  impaired?) software-reconfigure their mouse in such
a way that button 1 is actually on the right.


[END]

[HELP_Bugs]
			     Bugs


    The use of physical dimensions is imprecise, due either to
    a  bug  in	or  misuse  of	Xt macros for obtaining screen
    dimensions. This appears, for example, if you specify that
    a  plot  should  be 4" by 6". When printed, the dimensions
    will be approximately correct.

    Labels can contained  mixed  fonts	and  styles,  such  as
    superscripts.  There  is occasionally a one pixel error in
    baseline placement from one segment to the next. This will
    be	fixed  as  soon as we figure out why the Motif routine
    for returning the baseline of a string always gives zero.

    You may find that the delete  key  deletes	in  the  wrong
    direction  (to  the  right)  when  editing	text.  This is
    because Motif inexplicably defaults the delete key	action
    as	"delete right". This can be changed in a resource file
    (maybe someone has	already  done  it  for	you).  We  are
    searching  for  a  software  method to redefine the delete
    action to always be "delete left".

    hvplot will report many common errors it encounters in its
    data  file,  but  it is possible to present it with a data
    file that is so improperly formatted  (such  as  a	binary
    file) that the program crashes.


Please	report	any  bugs  you	encounter   with   hvplot   to
heddle@cebaf.gov

[HELP_Short Cuts]
			  Short Cuts

There are a variety of shortcuts available:

    To send a view/item to the "back", so that it  appears  to
    be	behind	all  other  views/items: while pressing SHIFT,
    click anywhere on the view using the LEFT mouse button.

    To return a plot to its original world  coordinate	system
    (i.e.,  to	undo  any and all all zooming): while pressing
    SHIFT, click anywhere on the plot using the  MIDDLE  mouse
    button.

    To close ALL views at once: while  pressing  SHIFT,  click
    the close box of any view.

    To "freeze" the feedback, hold the shift  key  down  while
    dragging.

[END]


[HELP_Feedback]

			   Feedback

The small hvplot feedback area is located in the  command  bar
of  each plot view. When the cursor is positioned over a plot,
the x-y position  (in the plot's coordinate  system)  will  be
reported.

Special Feature: Feedback is disabled when the	Shift  key  is
pressed.  This is useful when you want the feedback text for a
certain location to be included in a printout. Move the cursor
to  the desired location, press Shift, and move the cursor out
of the "hot-rect". The feedback text is "stuck" at  the  point
Shift is pressed.

[END]

[HELP_Adding a New Plot View]

		      Adding a new view

To add a new view, select "New Plot View..." from  the	Action
Menu.  An independent plotting canvas will be created. You can
read plot files from the new canvas in the same manner as  the
original.

[END]


[HELP_Controlling Views]

		      Controlling Views

Views are very much like other windows, such as those  created
by  a  window  manager	under  Unix or on a Macintosh. We will
discuss in turn  the  various  ways  that  the	views  can  be
manipulated.

Hiding the view

    In the upper left corner of the view  is  a  small	square
    enclosing  an  even smaller square. Clicking here with the
    left (first) mouse	button	will  cause  the  view	to  be
    hidden.  It  can  be  redisplayed by selecting it from the
    Views menu.

Moving the view

    The rectangular region around the title  of  the  view  is
    used  to  drag it around the main window. Depress and hold
    the left (first) mouse button anywhere in this  rectangle.
    Drag  the  outline to the desired location and release the
    mouse  button.  The  view  will  be  redrawn  at  the  new
    location.

Exploding/Imploding the view


    The small square in the upper right corner of a view  will
    toggle  the  display  between  its	present size and full-
    screen.


Resizing the view


    Views can be resized by  dragging  from  the  resize  area
    located in the bottom-right corner of the view.


Zooming the view


Bringing the view to the front

    The view can be brought to the front (so that  it  appears
    to	be  on	top of all other views and is not occluded) by
    clicking on any non-control area (an example of a  control
    area  is  the  dragging  rectangle)  with the left (first)
    mouse button. If the view is  completely  occluded,  other
    views  will  have  to  be  sent  to the back (see the text
    section).

Sending the view to the back

    The view can be sent to the back (so that it appears to be
    underneath all other views) in either of two ways:

      1) By selecting "Send To Back"  from  the  view's  popup
      menu

      2) By depressing the "SHIFT" key and clicking  with  the
      middle mouse button anywhere on the view.

[END]


[HELP_Main Menus]

			The Main Menus

Action Menu

    "Refresh Screen"

      This causes the entire window to be redrawn in the event
      that  it	gets  cor- rupted. It should rarely if ever be
      needed.


    "Background Color..."

      Permits the user to change the background color.

    "New Plot View"

      Creates additional, independent plot views.

    "Print Screen..."

      Prints all views on the main  window.  Probably  not  as
      useful  as  the  methods used to print individual views,
      i.e. the camera button and the view popup.

    "Quit..."

      Quits hvplot after providing a chance to veto.

Views Menu

    Each item in the Views Menu  corresponds  to  a  View.  At
    startup  there  will be just one: the default plot canvas.
    You  can  open  and  close	the  views  by	selecting  the
    corresponding  item.  As  more views are added, more items
    will appear in the Views menu.


Help Menu

    The "Help" item brings up this help window.

    The "Show/Hide Balloons" item turns  on/turns  off	ballon
    help.  With  the  ballon  help  on, moving the cursor over
    certain items will cause a help message inside  a  balloon
    to appear.


[END]

[HELP_Printing]

			   Printing

There are three ways to print views.

    1) The "Print Screen..."  command  from  the  Action  menu
    prints all visible views.

    2) The "Print View..." command from a  view's  popup  menu
    prints just that view.

    3) The "camera" button can be used in lieu of the  pop  up
    menu to, again, print just that view.


From the print dialog box, the user can  choose  to  send  the
output	 directly   to	a  printer  or,  alternatively,  to  a
postscript or  encapsulated  postscript  file.	One  can  also
choose	to  print  just  the  contents of a view or the entire
view. The main difference is that the entire view will include
the  feedback  area  and  will	have  the  same  3D sculptured
appearance as on the screen. The contents-only option  is  for
no-frills no nonsense printing.

The views are printed full sized, if it fits  on  a  page,  or
scaled	down  to  just fit.  The views are never cropped. When
capturing a single view, it doesn't matter where  it  sits  on
the main window; it will be centered on the page.

The views will print in color. For the most  part,  they  will
look  exactly  like  the  view on the screen. However, certain
unimportant liberties were taken  to  improve  the  postscript
output	-- for example colors may be changed slightly to avoid
excessive "dithering". They will also look nice printed  on  a
good quality gray scale postscript printer.

When printing on a black and white printer, you  may  want  to
try the "print all colors as black" option.

The delay box in the printer setup is so that you can dash  to
the printer and make sure the transparencies are loaded!

[END]

[HELP_View Popup]

		       View Popup Menu

Holding the right (third) mouse button done while  the	cursor
is anywhere over a view will cause a popup menu to appear.

From the popup menu you can  print  the  view  (equivalent  to
using the camera button), send it to the back, or delete it.

Note: the "ghosted" items in the popup view are  not  relevant
for hvplot. They are generated by the underlying Hv library.

[END]

[HELP_Drawing Tools]
			Drawing Tools

The drawing  tools  across  the  top  of  a  view  are	fairly
standard.  They  permit  annotation  of  the plot with strings
(labels), rectangles, ovals, lines and polygons. (The polygons
are  auto-closing  from  a  double-click.)  The objects can be
dragged (see the note below), reshaped, and edited (by	double
clicking).  To reshape a line, rectangle, oval, or polygon use
the mouse to grab an invisible (and small) square on  the  end
of the line, corners of a rectangle, vertices of a polygon, or
90 degree positions of an oval.

The camera (at least it's supposed  to	look  like  a  camera)
button	is  used  to  print  just that view, as opposed to the
entire screen (which might contain many  views).  Printing  is
discussed in more detail in the next section.

When using a drawing tool, if the initial click  is  inside  a
plot,  the  created  object  becomes a child of the plot. That
means when the plot is dragged around, the  object  goes  with
it.  If the object itself  is dragged outside of a plot, it is
STILL a child of the  original	plot,  even  if  dragged  onto
another  plot.	There  is  no way to change the parent. If the
intial click is outside a plot (on the bare white), the object
will  be  an  orphan.	Objects that are orphans are not saved
when the save button is selected.

[END]

[HELP_Read and Save]
		    Read and Save Buttons

The read and save buttons on the command bar along the top  of
a  view  provide obvious access to hvplot's the .plt file to a
dialog box.

When the read button is pressed,  a  standard  file  selection
box is presented which filters on .plt files. When the file is
selected it will immediately be  read  in  and	displayed.  If
there  are  already  plots displayed on the view, you be asked
whether you want to append the new  plots  to  the  old  (i.e.
display more plots) or first delete all the existing plots.

The save button will create  a	new  .plt  file.  This	is  an
alternative  to  manually  editing  the  file itself. The save
button will be "ghosted" if the view contains no  plots,  such
as at start-up.

[END]

[HELP_Zooming]

			   Zooming

Zooming is performed by creating a "zoom-rectangle" over  part
of  a  plot.   The  zoom-rectangle  is created by pointing and
dragging over the  view  while	the  MIDDLE  mouse  button  is
pressed  and  held.  The  zoom	will cause the area inside the
zoom-rectangle to expand and fill the whole "hot-rect".
