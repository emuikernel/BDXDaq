Make a backup of the file Hv.sh, and follow the directions
therein. Your work will involve changing the definitions of
environment variables defined within Hv.sh to match your
system. These include such definitions as  the path to the Motif
library, etc.

FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS, READ THROUGH Hv.sh


After modifying Hv.sh, "source" it (C shell):
$ source Hv.sh


You are now ready to build the Hv library. Move to the Hv/src
subdirectory and issue a make command

$ make

That should do it. Any violent complaining will be the result
improper modification of the file Hv.sh. If this occurs,
try to interpret the error message in terms of which environment
variable was not properly set. If the procedure was successful,
the library libHv.a should now exist.

This procedure is repeated for each of the demo subdirectories.
Move to the subdirectory and issue a solitary make command.

                  K&R to ANSI Changes

The Computers in Physics (CIP) article states that Hv was
written in K & R C. However, since the galleys for the
article were returned we have converted to ANSI C.

******* Hv is now completely written in ANSI C ********

This is for those few who are using beta (K&R) releases
of Hv. If you downloaded Hv AFTER reading the CIP article,
or if the only version you ever had uses the ANSI prototyping,
then you can ignore this missive.

When converting to ANSI, there was only one "unfixible"
incompatibility, which was the variable length argument lists.
In K&R C we included "varargs.h" and used the pre-ANSI methodology
-- which was actually better. It allowed for ALL the arguments to be
unnamed, i.e. you could have procedures with NO named (required)
arguments.

The ANSI implementation includes "stdarg.h" instead, which has
different versions of the va macros. In ANSI C, you MUST have at
least one named argument.

Thus the three Hv_Va... that previously had no required arguments were
modified -- and if you wrote to the K&R versions of Hv you WILL have to
change -- although it should just be an easy matter. The Hv_Va..
procedures that already had at least one required argument such
as Hv_VaCreateItem(View,...) did not need to be changed.

Here are the procedures that changed:

/*------ Hv_VaCreateDialog -----*/

OLD: Hv_Widget  Hv_VaCreateDialog(...)

NEW: void Hv_VaCreateDialog(Hv_Widget *dialog,
                            ...)

COMMENT: Instead of returning the newly created
Hv_Widget, a pointer to the Widget should be passed
as the first (and only required, apart from the
terminating NULL) argument. 

EXAMPLE OF NEW VERSION

    Hv_Widget    dialog;

    Hv_VaCreateDialog(&dialog,
	              Hv_TITLE, "Variable Zoom",
	              NULL);




/*------ Hv_VaCreateMenu -----*/

OLD: Hv_Widget  Hv_VaCreateDialog(...)

NEW: void Hv_VaCreateDialog(Hv_Widget *menu,
                            ...)

COMMENT: Instead of returning the newly created
Hv_Widget, a pointer to the Widget should be passed
as the first (and only required, apart from the
terminating NULL) argument. 

EXAMPLE OF NEW VERSION

    Hv_Widget    menu;

    Hv_VaCreateMenu(&menu,
	            Hv_TYPE, Hv_SUBMENUTYPE,
	            NULL);




/*------ Hv_VaCreateView -----*/

OLD: Hv_View  Hv_VaCreateView(...)

NEW: void Hv_VaCreateView(Hv_View *view,
                          ...)

COMMENT: Instead of returning the newly created
Hv_View, a pointer to the View should be passed
as the first (and only required, apart from the
terminating NULL) argument. 

EXAMPLE OF NEW VERSION

    Hv_View    View;

    Hv_VaCreateMenu(&View,
	            Hv_TAG, MERCATORVIEW,
	            NULL);
