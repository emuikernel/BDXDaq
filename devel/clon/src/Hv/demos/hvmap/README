This is a new demo, not described in the manual. It will
display a mercator map projection.

First you must build the binary map data file. The program
will expect to find it in the same directory as the executable,
or in a subdirectory called "mapmaker", and expects it (the binary file)
to be named "hv.maps".

The binary map file is built from an ACSII map file in the
subdirectory called mapmaker. In that directory, build the
converter program "mapmaker" via the make file. This builds
a simple non-graphical text-menu diriven converter. Run
mapmaker, type "c" to convert a map, type hvmaps.txt when prompted
for the ascii file, type "hv.maps" for the name of the converted
binary file.

You can substitue higher resolution maps. Most that you find
on the net will be (or able to produce an ascii file) in a form 
similar to the supplied "hv.maps". Even high-res maps draw very
quickly.

The "name" of each map in the ASCII FILE is important. First as sort
of a comment, and secondly in how the map is interpreted. The maps
are assigned one of three types based on the name (case insensitive):

1) It is a water map if the name contains "sea" or "lake". These
will be draw in colors designated for water. 

2) It is a "border" if it contains "border". A border is an unclosed
polygon and will not be filled. A good example would be state boundaries
(unless you wanted each state to be filled in a different color)

3) If it is neither 1 or 2, it will be designated a "land map".

note: there are no border maps in hvmaps.txt.

Summary:

The steps to build and run "hvmap":

0) Build the Hv library

1) Move to the directory "mapmaker"

   A) build "mapreader" via the makefile
   B) run "mapreader"

      i)   choose "c" (convert)
      ii)  enter "hvmaps.txt" as the ascii file
      iii) enter "hv.maps" as the binary file

2) Move back up to the hvmap directory

3) Build hvmap via the makefile, as with the other hv demos.
