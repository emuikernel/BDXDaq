[HELP_Drawing Tools]
                        Drawing Tools

The drawing tools when presenton a view are  fairly  standard.
They  permit  annotation  of  the  view with strings (labels),
rectangles, ovals,  lines  and  polygons.  (The  polygons  are
auto-closing  from a double-click.) The objects can be dragged
(see  the  note  below),  reshaped,  and  edited  (by   double
clicking).  To reshape a line, rectangle, oval, or polygon use
the mouse to grab an invisible (and small) square on  the  end
of the line, corners of a rectangle, vertices of a polygon, or
90 degree positions of an oval.

The camera  button is used to print just that view, as opposed
to the entire screen (which might contain many views).

[HELP_Main Menus]

                        The Main Menus

Action Menu

    "Refresh Screen"

      This causes the entire window to be redrawn in the event
      that  it  gets  cor- rupted. It should rarely if ever be
      needed.


    "Background Color..."

      Permits the user to change the background color.

    "Print Screen..."

      Prints all views on the main  window.  Probably  not  as
      useful  as  the  methods used to print individual views,
      i.e. the camera button and the view popup.

    "Quit..."

      Quits the application after providing a chance to veto.

Views Menu

    Each item in the Views Menu corresponds to  a  View.   You
    can  open  (or  bring to the front, if it is already open)
    any view by selecting  the  corresponding  item.  As  more
    views are added, more items will appear in the Views menu.


Help Menu

    The "Help" item brings up this help window.

    The "Show/Hide Balloons" item turns  on/turns  off  ballon
    help.  With  the  ballon  help  on, moving the cursor over
    certain items will cause a help message inside  a  balloon
    to appear.

[HELP_Interface Basics]
                       Interface Basics

Single and double clicking, when used to initiate  an  action,
is always performed with the left mouse button.

Special features are often  accessed  through  shift-clicking,
wherein   the  shift  key  and  a  mouse  button  are  pressed
simultaneously.

Zooming is performed with the middle mouse  button.  "Drag"  a
rectangle (with the middle button pressed and held) within the
hotrect, and that particular view will zoom. Other views  will
not be affected.

Popup menus are accessed with the third mouse button.

If it seems as if you should be able to  drag  something,  you
probably  can. Click on it with the left mouse button, keep it
pressed, and drag the object around.

If it seems that some object should be "editable", it probably
is. Double click on an object to bring up its editor.

To delete objects (including plots), bring up their editor (by
double clicking) and hit the delete button.

A political correctness alert. We use  the  term  "LEFT  mouse
button"  when we should use "mouse button 1", with full malice
of forethought and  the  realization  that  some  left-handers
(helicity  impaired?) software-reconfigure their mouse in such
a way that button 1 is actually on the right.

[HELP_Virtual Desktop View]
                     Virtual Desktop View

If the virtual desktopview is present on your application,  It
expands  the  desktop  such  that  views  can be open but off-
screen. A small representation of  every  open  view  will  be
visible on the virtual desktop view.

Placing the pointer over the small  rectangle  representing  a
view  in  the  virtual desktop view will cause its title to be
displayed in the virtual desktop view's hotrect.

There are three basic manipulations available of items in  the
virtual desktop view's hotrect:

    The green viewport can be dragged around, altering what is
    visible on the physical screen.

    A representation of a view can be dragged into or  out  of
    the viewport, changing is visibility.

    A representation of a view can  be  double-clicked  cusing
    the view port to center itself around the view.

    [END]

[HELP_Short Cuts]
                          Short Cuts

There are a variety of shortcuts available:

    To send a view to the "back", so that  it  appears  to  be
    behind  all  other  views:  while  pressing  SHIFT,  click
    anywhere on the view using the LEFT mouse button.

    To return a view to its original world  coordinate  system
    (i.e.,  to  undo  any and all all zooming): while pressing
    SHIFT, click anywhere on the view using the  MIDDLE  mouse
    button.

    To close ALL views at once: while  pressing  SHIFT,  click
    the close box of any view.

    The same paradigm applies to most items  in  the  HotRect.
    Click them once to bring them to the front. Shift click to
    send them behind other items. Double click to bring up  an
    item's editor.

[END]


[HELP_Feedback]

                           Feedback

The feedback area is one of the more powerful Hv features.  It
is  the area adjacent to the display rectangle (the "hotrect")
which is constantly updated with information as the pointer is
moved over the drawing.

Special Feature: Feedback is disabled when the  Shift  key  is
pressed.  This is useful when you want the feedback text for a
certain location to be included in a printout. Move the cursor
to  the desired location, press Shift, and move the cursor out
of the "hot-rect". The feedback text is "stuck" at  the  point
Shift is pressed.

[END]


[HELP_Controlling Views]

                      Controlling Views

Views are very much like other windows, such as those  created
by  a  window  manager  under  Unix or on a Macintosh. We will
discuss  in  turn  the  various  ways  that   views   can   be
manipulated.

Hiding the view

    In the upper left corner of the view  is  a  small  square
    enclosing  an  even smaller square. Clicking here with the
    left (first) mouse  button  will  cause  the  view  to  be
    hidden.  It  can  be  redisplayed by selecting it from the
    Views menu.

Moving the view

    The rectangular region around the title  of  the  view  is
    used  to  drag it around the main window. Depress and hold
    the left (first) mouse button anywhere in this  rectangle.
    Drag  the  outline to the desired location and release the
    mouse  button.  The  view  will  be  redrawn  at  the  new
    location.

Exploding/Imploding the view

    Use the explode button at the upper right  corner  of  the
    view.

Resizing the view

    Use the resize handle at the bottom right  corner  of  the
    view.

Zooming the view

    Use the middle mouse button to "rubber-band"  a  rectangle
    with  the  view's  HotRect.  The  view  will  zoom  to the
    selected rectangle.  Some views may  have  their  "Square"
    draw control bit set (see the Hv Manual) in which case you
    are forced to drag a rectangle with the same aspect  ratio
    as the HotRect (to prevent distortion).

    Zooming is also possible with the right mouse button popup
    menu.

Bringing the view to the front

    The view can be brought to the front (so that  it  appears
    to  be  on  top of all other views and is not occluded) by
    clicking on any non-control area (an example of a  control
    area  is  the  dragging  rectangle)  with the left (first)
    mouse button. Another way to bring the view to  the  front
    is to select it from the Views menu.

Sending the view to the back

    The view can be sent to the back (so that it appears to be
    underneath all other views) in either of two ways:

      1) By selecting "Send To Back"  from  the  view's  popup
      menu

      2) By depressing the "SHIFT" key and clicking  with  the
      middle mouse button anywhere on the view.



[END]


[HELP_Printing]

                           Printing


There are three ways to print views.

    1) The "Print Screen..."  command  from  the  Action  menu
    prints all visible views.

    2) The "Print View..." command from a  view's  popup  menu
    prints just that view.

    3) On certain views the "camera" button  can  be  used  in
    lieu of the pop up menu to, again, print just that view.


From the print dialog box, the user can  choose  to  send  the
output  directly  to  a  printer or, alternatively, to a file.
One can also choose to print just the contents of  a  view  or
the  entire  view. The main difference is that the entire view
will include the feedback area  and  will  have  the  same  3D
sculptured  appearance  as  on  the  screen. The contents-only
option is for no-frills, no nonsense printing.   Finally,  you
can  choose  between  portrait and landscape modes.  The delay
text field does just that: it delays  the  printing.  This  is
useful  if  you  have  to  dash  to  the  printer to make some
adjustment, such as putting in view graphs.

The views are printed full sized, if it fits  on  a  page,  or
scaled  down  to  just fit.  The views are never cropped. When
capturing a single view, it doesn't matter where  it  sits  on
the main window; it will be centered on the page.

The views will print in color. For the most  part,  they  will
look  exactly  like  the  view on the screen. However, certain
unimportant liberties were taken  to  improve  the  postscript
output  -- for example colors may be changed slightly to avoid
excessive "dithering". They will also look nice printed  on  a
good quality gray scale postscript printer.

[END]

[HELP_View Popup]

                       View Popup Menu

Holding the right (third) mouse button done while  the  cursor
is anywhere over a view will cause a popup menu to appear.

These items should be self-explanatory.

Note: not all of these operations are available for all views.

[END]

[HELP_Zooming]

                           Zooming

Zooming is performed by creating a "zoom-rectangle"  over  the
part  of  a  view  which  contains  the  actual  drawing  (the
"hotrect"). The zoom-rectangle  is  created  by  pointing  and
dragging  over  the  view  while  the  MIDDLE  mouse button is
pressed and held. The zoom will  cause  the  area  inside  the
zoom-rectangle to expand and fill the whole "hot-rect".

Zooming can also be performed with the view's popup  menu.  It
allows  for  various  zooms  by a fixed percentage, a variable
zoom by specifying the percentage (less than  100  means  zoom
in,  more than 100 means zoom out) as well as (for some views)
"quick" zooming to selected regions.
