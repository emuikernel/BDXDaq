[HELP_Short Cuts]
                          Short Cuts

There are a variety of shortcuts available:

    To send a view to the "back", so that  it  appears  to  be
    behind  all  other  views:  while  pressing  SHIFT,  click
    anywhere on the view using the LEFT mouse button.

    To return a view to its original world  coordinate  system
    (i.e.,  to  undo  any and all all zooming): while pressing
    SHIFT, click anywhere on the view using the  MIDDLE  mouse
    button.

    To close ALL views at once: while  pressing  SHIFT,  click
    the close box of any view.

    The same paradigm applies to most items  in  the  HotRect.
    Click them once to bring them to the front. Shift click to
    send them behind other items. Double click to bring up  an
    item's editor.

[HELP_Feedback]

                           Feedback

The feedback area is one of the more powerful Hv features.  It
is the area adjacent to the display rectangle (the "hot-rect")
which is constantly updated with information as the pointer is
moved over the drawing.

Special Feature: Feedback is disabled when the  Shift  key  is
pressed.  This is useful when you want the feedback text for a
certain location to be included in a printout. Move the cursor
to  the desired location, press Shift, and move the cursor out
of the "hot-rect". The feedback text is "stuck" at  the  point
Shift is pressed.

[HELP_Controlling Views]

                      Controlling Views

Views are very much like other windows, such as those  created
by  a  window  manager  under  Unix or on a Macintosh. We will
discuss  in  turn  the  various  ways  that   views   can   be
manipulated.

Hiding the view

    In the upper left corner of the view  is  a  small  square
    enclosing  an  even smaller square. Clicking here with the
    left (first) mouse  button  will  cause  the  view  to  be
    hidden.  It  can  be  redisplayed by selecting it from the
    Views menu.

Moving the view

    The rectangular region around the title  of  the  view  is
    used  to  drag it around the main window. Depress and hold
    the left (first) mouse button anywhere in this  rectangle.
    Drag  the  outline to the desired location and release the
    mouse  button.  The  view  will  be  redrawn  at  the  new
    location.

Exploding/Imploding the view

    Use the explode button at the upper right  corner  of  the
    view.

Resizing the view

    Use the resize handle at the bottom right  corner  of  the
    view.

Zooming the view

    Use the middle mouse button to "rubber-band"  a  rectangle
    with  the  view's  HotRect.  The  view  will  zoom  to the
    selected rectangle.  Some views may  have  their  "Square"
    draw control bit set (see the Hv Manual) in which case you
    are forced to drag a rectangle with the same aspect  ratio
    as the HotRect (to prevent distortion).

    Zooming is also possible with the right mouse button popup
    menu.

Bringing the view to the front

    The view can be brought to the front (so that  it  appears
    to  be  on  top of all other views and is not occluded) by
    clicking on any non-control area (an example of a  control
    area  is  the  dragging  rectangle)  with the left (first)
    mouse button. If the view is  completely  occluded,  other
    views  will  have  to  be  sent  to the back (see the text
    section).

Sending the view to the back

    The view can be sent to the back (so that it appears to be
    underneath all other views) in either of two ways:

      1) By selecting "Send To Back"  from  the  view's  popup
      menu

      2) By depressing the "SHIFT" key and clicking  with  the
      middle mouse button anywhere on the view.



[END]


[HELP_Printing]

                           Printing


There are three ways to print views.

    1) The "Print Screen..."  command  from  the  Action  menu
    prints all visible views.

    2) The "Print View..." command from a  view's  popup  menu
    prints just that view.

    3) On certain views the "camera" button  can  be  used  in
    lieu of the pop up menu to, again, print just that view.


From the print dialog box, the user can  choose  to  send  the
output   directly   to  a  printer  or,  alternatively,  to  a
postscript or  encapsulated  postscript  file.  One  can  also
choose  to  print  just  the  contents of a view or the entire
view. The main difference is that the entire view will include
the  feedback  area  and  will  have  the  same  3D sculptured
appearance as on the screen. The contents-only option  is  for
no-frills,  no  nonsense  printing.   Finally,  you can choose
between portrait and landscape modes.  The  delay  text  field
does  just that: it delays the printing. This is useful if you
have to dash to the printer to make some adjustment,  such  as
putting in view graphs.

The views are printed full sized, if it fits  on  a  page,  or
scaled  down  to  just fit.  The views are never cropped. When
capturing a single view, it doesn't matter where  it  sits  on
the main caps window; it will be centered on the page.

The views will print in color. For the most  part,  they  will
look  exactly  like  the  view on the screen. However, certain
unimportant liberties were taken  to  improve  the  postscript
output  -- for example colors may be changed slightly to avoid
excessive "dithering". They will also look nice printed  on  a
good quality gray scale postscript printer.

[END]

[HELP_View Popup]

                       View Popup Menu

Holding the right (third) mouse button done while  the  cursor
is anywhere over a view will cause a popup menu to appear.

From the popup menu  you  can  customize  the  view,  changing
things  like  what  detector packages are to be drawn. You can
zoom in various manners. You can also  refresh  or  print  the
view.

Note: not all of these operations are available for all views.

[END]

[HELP_Zooming]

                           Zooming

Zooming is performed by creating a "zoom-rectangle"  over  the
part  of  a  view  which  contains the actual drawing (in caps
parlance, the "hot-rect"). The zoom-rectangle  is  created  by
pointing  and  dragging  over  the view while the MIDDLE mouse
button is pressed and held.  The  zoom  will  cause  the  area
inside  the  zoom-rectangle to expand and fill the whole "hot-
rect".

Zooming can also be performed with the view's popup  menu.  It
allows  for  various  zooms  by a fixed percentage, a variable
zoom by specifying the percentage (less than  100  means  zoom
in,  more than 100 means zoom out) as well as (for some views)
"quick" zooming to selected regions.
